What is this?
<===========>
AQ2SP is made for Action Quake 2, one of the most popular Quake 2 mods ever. AQ2SP enhances this DM/Teamplay Mod by adding Single Player monsters to several of the more popular AQ2 maps, without downloading an entire new map. Currently skill levels are not implemented.

How do I install it?
<==================>
Install the package to the Drive/Dir that contains Quake2.exe. For example,
if Quake 2 is installed here:

C:\Quake2		Unzip to C:Quake2
C:\Games\Quake2		Unzip to C:\Games\Quake2

Of course with restore paths ON!

What is supplied in the package?
<==============================>
* EntZ, this allows loading/dumping .ent files (\release dir).
* Several map entity lists (see below).
* Promagnon's Single Player DLL (1.07).
* An easy to use frontend. This is installed to your Quake2 root (ie C:\Quake2\).

<=====>
You are free to distribute this package throughout the internet or other medias, as long as I am notified and you will not recieve any sort of fee or compensation.

EntZ and the Single Player DLl are used with the author's permission. Their readme files are included.

Since the BSP files are not modified, I don't see why explecit permission each level author is needed. If you, as the creator of a map, wish to see your level's support removed, please inform me and I will take action.

Additional Thanks

ID Software, The A-Team, Gunz! (the author of EntZ), Promagnon, and all the beta testers.
