ID SOFTWARE for Quake 2

Grampa for helpin with linux ver!!

INSTALLATION
------------
Backup your gamex86.dll in your action directory by renaming it
(example, "ren gamex86.dll gamex86.bak")
copy the gamex86.dll file of my mod into your /action directory

to start a co-op game, type:

quake2 +set game action +set coop 1 +map base1

to start single player type:

quake2 +set game action +map base1

to start a team game type:

quake2 +set game action +set teamplay 1 +map <name of map to play on>

if you're using this dll, and you make a server, the ones connecting to it NEED NOT
have the dll to play.
If you have the dll, you will still be able to play unaffected on public, regular
action quake servers.
if you have the dll and want to play regular team action (why????) then just
delete the gamex86.dll and rename the backup to gamex86.dll.

I suggest a really fast server and high bandwidth connectees for internet co-op play
due to the high number of entities (monsters AND players), far greater than in
normal deathmatch or teamplay where there are only players...  those with fast
connex, make sure you type "rate 10000" in the console.

To ignore someone (if they are being obnoxious)... try typing
ignore <their name> 
in the console
and 
unignore
(all by itself) to stop ignoring them
you can also type 
ignore
(all by itself) to get status on who you're ignoring.

I also suggest you type "weapons 5" and "items 5" in order to be allowed
to carry all the items and weapons at the same time.

VERSION 1.09

In this version:

* Tweaks to hell mode
* fixed the vanishing items
* Fixed the damn overflows in certain levels (fact2)
* Tweaked ammo droppage (Gunners could give you grenades now)

Single player has been heavily modified.

In Version 1.07:

* Ultra violence nightmare hell mode.  Try skill 3.  Spray and pray, baby!
* In Skill 3 mode Ammo is more plentiful (dropped ammo).
* In skill 3 mode monsters do 3x more damage
* In skill 3 mode monsters take 2x more damage before dying.
* Compatiblility with the WEAPON server cvar.  Servers, type "weapon <number>" and
  players will be allowed to carry that many weapons, double if bandolierd.
* Key spawn in certain levels is fixt.  You can now win (hopefully) without any 
  give commands.
* God mode is completely protective now
* I cannot make it tell me that the function pointers have moved so I guess that's 
  fixed also
* Cheats are enabled by typing "cheats 1" before starting a game.
* Ammo drops bugfixed.
* Damage tweaked to monsters
* weapon spawn tweaked.
* Leg damage for monsters.


NOTE as of this version I have made changes which could affect deathmatch and teamplay.
The change is: the placement of weapons.  Thats all.

In version 1.06:

* Shot gun in SINGLE and CO-OP ONLY(!) is made to hurt monsters more, to simulate
  the additional damage of bleeding that would normally be taken.
* Co-op items handling and weapons handling bettered.
* now co-op responds to the "friendly_fire" dmflag
* now sv_cheats 0 disallows cheating
* weapons dont vanish after being dropped in co-op and single
* power cubes fixups
* silencer and slippers and knifes are stealthy to monsters... most of the time...
* fraglimit for team games gets set to 5000 if its below 100 (because of the new
  scoring mode...)
* cannot kick teammates weapons out their hands in co-op
* co-op is non-player damaging if "friendly_fire" is on, regardless of skin or
  model
* monsters drop stuff... soldiers drop knifes and clips and gladiators drop sniper
  rounds. (But not always!)
* monsters dont instagib... you need to cause damage lots.
* a body blocking an elevator or door can now be removed by gibbing it... knife it
  to pieces or blow it up or shoot it to bits.  Bodies blocking "must move" elevators
  and doors are gibbed instantly, or move with the plat if possible.
* monsters might not notice you sneak with slippers... unless you do it blatantly.
* a silenced gun ALMOST always will not alert monsters untill its too late for them
* missed knifes only have a 20 percent chance of being noticed.  
* bandolier lets you carry 2 guns in single and co-op.  No more picking up as many
  guns as you want or as many items as you want.

In version 1.05:

* Knifes fall out of monsters when kill them with one... but only if you KILL them
  with it, not if you damage them with it... otherwise you'd have infinite knives
  basically...
* Monsters dropping non-aq2 items fixed, apparently (from 8 hrs play testing)
* Damn body armor bug fixed.
* COOP mode now shouldn't crash when a player dies.
* UnIgnore command, type 'ignore <name>' to ignore someone, and 'unignore' to stop.
* Monsters can suffer head shots (with appropriate noise, damage and bloodyness)
* Coop mode is now 2.5x harder than single to win. (heehe)
* Special items are spawned:  Silencer->silencer, Invuner->body armor, Quad->laser
  sight, adrenaline->bandolier
* Dual pistols go where super shot gun used to be so that certain levels and goals
  are triggered.
* fixed someone elses sloppy code that made the tank's and gunners bounding boxes 
  too big and too small respectively.  Same with medic and gladiator.

In 1.04

* Saving and loading games is now un-fuxored, MOSTLY.
* progressing from level to level in single player is also un-fuxored, MOSTLY.

In 1.03

* keys, powercubes, etc. now work
* monsters can drop stuff like ammo or knifes
* monster weaponary is more aq-like (watch out for the rail gun monsters, now they
  shoot sniper rounds at ya)
* Monsters aim at your chest/stomach area instad of head, (although the spread and inaccuracy of the monsters mean some head shots.
* Lots of other stuff especially monster sound code, health modified and stuff, and effects. 
* Multiplayer head shot effects, as well as better team scoring.

In this version you can ignore one person, in future versions possibly more.
