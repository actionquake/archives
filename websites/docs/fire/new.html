<p><em>New for V1.35</em></p>
<p>You can tell I was bored this week. I remembered a discussion I had with someone about the accuracy of the sniper rifle when running and walking and that. So I've added a new server variable, accurate_sniper, which defaults to 1. When activated (1) the sniper is as it always has been, accurate. When set to 0, the sniper takes on inaccuracy when the user moves.</p>
<p>When running the sniper is as accurate as the pistol when walking. When walking the sniper is as accurate as the pistol when standing. When standing or crouched the sniper is deadly accurate.</p>
<p>I'm hoping this can help combat the massive amount of snipers out there, now that most servers have moved anti-gren. In any case this needs to be enabled to take any effect, so it isn't a default option.</p>
<p><em>New for V1.3</em></p>
<p>Just the locations stuff has been added.</p>
<p>This allows users to add the %L bit into their say_team commands to report their current position. This doesn't work like the CTF location system which is pretty crappy for AQ2 tbh, but uses location files. Users can create custom files if they like, (using the in built editmode), but they will need to upload them to the server. The server will use default locations files for you if you don't have a custom one on the server. </p>
<p>For more information on creating your own files, download V1.3 and see the locations.txt file for a better description of the commands.</p>
<p>But trust me guys, this addon is gonna make teamplay a lot more fun. Thanks for the idea Tedium (yes he's getting good at this isn't he?).</p>
<p><em>New for V1.2</em></p>
<p>Right, lots of updates here.</p>
<li>Moved the position of the skin indicator (thanks to Tedium for that suggestion)</li>
<li>Team names now rename when Team Leader leaves the team.</li>
<li>Spawning system tweaked (it ain't gonna get any better than this I'm afraid)</li>
<li>Slight tweak in the menu system</li>
<li>New Scoreboard, MUCH better this one.</li>
<li>Team command now displays all the people in your team</li>
<li>IR vision now starts enabled</li>
<p>I've done a load of other minor updates, and all in all it's working
a lot better now. I'll get a server up ASAP</p>
<p><em>New for V1.15</em></p>
<p>OK I noticed the DM mode wasn't working properly with the skin icon.
Thats fixed now, and I've added another server variable.</p>
<li>New Server Variable - match_countdown</li>
<ul type=circle>
	<li> Usage - 'match_countdown x' where x is in seconds</li>
	<li> Sets the length of the countdown before a game starts</li>
</ul>
