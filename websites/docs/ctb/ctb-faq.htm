<H1>MBCTB News</H1>
<P>March 26<BR>The 0.50 version has been released! Look for the new DLL near the 
bottom. It's a server only upgrade, so client v.04 will still work.</P>

<H1>[6e9]rrRYAN's 5-second MBCTB FAQ </H1>
<P>Ok, here's a quick little FAQ I whipped up for Mr. Brian's Capture the 
Briefcase (MBCTB). This isn't by any means official, or necessarily 100% 
accurate, it's just something I wrote so I send people to it instead of 
explaining the whole thing while juggling an MP5 and a briefcase.</P>
<H2>1. What are those big white "diapers" on people? What are all the picture 
not found errors I'm getting?</H2>
<P>You need the pak file for MBCTB. It's not a doozy by any means (22k, I 
believe), and is available <A 
href="http://www.furnation.com/brian/action/aq2-ctb-client.04.zip">here</A>.</P>
<H2>2. Ok, I'm not getting spammed by error messages any more, now what?</H2>
<P>Well, not you need to pick a team and inventory just like in normal AQ, then 
hit fire and you'll be instantly dropped into the game. Before I explain the 
object, let me touch on some key differeces between MBCTB and normal AQ. The 
biggest one (other than the obvious briefcases, which I'll get to), is that 
MBCTB is no longer "die and stay dead". After you die, you must sit around for a 
certain amount of time (a server variable, defaults to 20 seconds). Hit fire 
when the timer above your life hits zero, and *poof* you're back in the game. 
Remember to hit fire (there's been several times where I've sat chatting well 
beyond the timer expiration..)</P>
<P>So, now, run around and kill people just like in AQ.</P>
<H2>3. Ok, I've killed tons of people, but that's getting old. Wasn't there 
something about briefcases?</H2>
<P>Oh, so you wanna actually play the game how it's meant to be played, huh? Ok. 
Well, at the start of every round, you'll notice a briefcase sitting at your 
spawn point. When God or the director or however it is who says "Action!" says 
"Action!", one of your teammates should pick that puppy up and get it to a safe 
place. Why, you ask? Well, the goal of MBCTB is for one PERSON (not one team) to 
hold both briefcases. When that happens, his team wins. So, you COULD run out 
blazing with the case, but chances are you'll get gunned down, so it's always 
smarter to let someone not holding the case take the risks. But, since this is a 
FAQ and not a tutorial, I won't get much into strategy here.</P>
<H2>4. Hey! This dead persons talking to me!! What's up with that?!?</H2>
<P>Spooky, huh? Well, unlike normal AQ, dead people CAN communicate with the 
living.</P>
<H2>5. What? Is that a bug?</H2>
<P>No. Basically, dead people are meant to act as scouts and commanders for the 
live ones. So don't waste your dead time plotting how you're gonna get back at 
that guy for handcannon-ing you from behind, spend it looking for the other 
team's flag and telling your teammates whats in store for them. Without good 
communication between the living and the dead, it's neary impossible to find the 
other team's briefcase on some maps.</P>
<H2>6. Who made this crazy thing?</H2>
<P>Well, I'm no genius, but judging from the title, I'd say <A 
href="mailto:brianyee@hotmail.com">Mr. Brian</A> did. If you see any bugs 
(keeping in mind Question #5), send 'em to him, not me. (All I did was write 
this little FAQ). This is a totally different AQ mod than the CTB currently in 
development by the Action Quake Development Team (AQDT). Neither mod is an 
"official" mod endorsed by Team Action.</P>
<H2>7. So, where do I play this crazy game?</H2>
<P>Good question. The easiest way to find MBCTB servers is to use <A 
href="http://www.gamespy.com/">GameSpy</A>. If you've enver used GameSpy, please 
consult their page for more information. <A 
href="http://gauntlet.telefragged.com/action/aq2_mbctb.qst">Here</A> is a MBCTB 
tab for GameSpy. If you want to make your own tab, MBCTB servers have the server 
variable "ctb" set to 1.<BR><BR>Or view a server list <A 
href="http://gauntlet.telefragged.com/action/ctbservers.html">here</A></P>
<H2>8. Help! The briefcase is stuck in the elevator shaft!</H2>
<P>Well, now who'd fault is that? Unfortuneately, there's no way to get that 
case back until the end of the round. So, don't be stupid and throw the case 
into inaccessible areas of he map. Also note that a bug in Q2 lets your throw 
items through glass windows. Server ops are very keen towards kicking players 
who repeatedly spoil the game, so while it's great to hide the briefcase, make 
sure you can get it back when your team needs to score. The latest build of 
MBCTB will respawn cases that get stuck behind a door or under a moving 
elevator, but the code can't tell the difference between an accessible and 
inaccessible hiding place.</P>
<H2>9. What's in those briefcases anyways?</H2>
<P>Golden Twinkies.</P>
<H2>10. Where do I get the server DLL?</H2>
