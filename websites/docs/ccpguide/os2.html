  OS/2-native server binaries are not available.



  A Quake 2 port for OS/2 never happened.  Quake 2 WILL work with OS/2, though, if you get:

  <A HREF="http://odin.netlabs.org/">http://odin.netlabs.org/</A>

  From the FAQ for that site:

  "Current version will convert and load many applications, but only those which use limited 
  set of API calls will actually work. That includes some simple applets that are shipped 
  with Windows 95/NT (Solitaire, Freecell, Notepad, Calculator, Telnet, WinHlp32...), but 
  also famous <B><I>Quake II game from ID Software (including network, multiplayer and Voodoo 
  3D support)</I></B>."

  You'll be able to run Quake 2.  This method MIGHT be able to convert any Windows-compiled 
  Action Quake 2 server binary, but I am not sure since I don't have access to an OS/2 Warp
  system.  The only other option would be to compile the AQ2 server code natively.  Since 
  the source code for 1.52 has been released, this is a very real possibility.
