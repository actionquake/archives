      <DIV align=left>If you have done your homework on AQ2, or are an 
      experienced quake2 player, you may be familiar with some or most of the 
      things I am about to tell you. The information in this document is to 
      familiarize you with the way a cleaner must control his mind body and 
      weaponry in order to succeed in our missions. As you will often be alone 
      and surrounded by your enemy, you will need to learn how to neutralize a 
      threat effectively. To do so you must first understand that can’t count on 
      others to help you out of a messy situation. You must be confident in you 
      ability if you are to succeed. To be a cleaner is to be a one man 
      army.</DIV></H5>

      <DIV align=center>CONTROLS</DIV></H3><BR>
      <H5>
      <DIV align=left>
      <P>We’ll start with controls. You must first be comfortable at all times 
      if you hope to succeed. You will often be fighting under poor conditions 
      against an overwhelming number of targets. The last person you want to be 
      battling is yourself.</P>
      <P>First I would suggest either the mouse/keyboard or trackball/keyboard 
      combos. The keyboard alone doesn’t allow you smooth movement necessary to 
      aim and move with speed and accuracy. A joystick normally doesn’t allow 
      you the fine control you need and you will often find yourself over 
      correcting or coming up short. Using a mouse to aim and a keyboard to move 
      seems to be the most popular (and practical) method. </P>
      <P>I have found that mice (or trackballs) with a wheel work the best. This 
      is because quake allows you to bind a function to scrolling up 
      (mswheelup), scrolling down (mswheeldown), and pressing down the wheel 
      (mouse3). These 3 functions in addition to the standard two buttons give 
      you five different commands. </P>
      <P>Ideally you should not have to move your keyboard hand more than a few 
      inches in any direction. Every time you have to look down at the keyboard 
      to find a key you are putting yourself in danger. You should be focused on 
      the screen and your controls should be natural not mechanical. The most 
      practical configuration I have found is to use the mouse for aiming and 
      turning (mouselook), and use the arrow keys for moving forward, backwards, 
      left and right. All of the other functions should be grouped as close to 
      the arrow keys as possible so you don’t have far to move your hand. The 
      great thing about the Quake2 engine is all controls are remapable. As long 
      as you know the console commands you can map the keyboard however you 
      wish. For a list of quake2 commands and how quake2 recognizes certain keys 
      (like number pad keys) I suggest a page called <A 
      href="http://www.planetquake.com/console/" target=_blank>The 
      Console</A>.</P>
      <P>This is a list of commands you will need to bind* to either your mouse 
      or keyboard. I suggest doing this in a custom config or <B>.cfg</B> file. 
      Some sample <B>.cfg</B> files will be available in our files section. This 
      list is designed for AQ2 and any commands unique to AQ2 are shown in red. 
      Try to make the commands you use frequently the most comfortable to reach 
      (we wouldn’t want you to suffer some horrible quake injury).</P>
      <P>Many of these commands you may wish to leave as their default but I 
      will give them to you anyway.</P>
      <P>*To bind a function open the console and type: <I>bind <FONT 
      color=#ffffff>key </FONT>"<FONT color=#ffffff>command</FONT>"</I>, where 
      <FONT color=#ffffff>key</FONT> is the input device like a keyboard key or 
      mouse button, and <FONT color=#ffffff>command</FONT> is the action you 
      wish the game to execute. Below is a list of some of the commands and 
      their corresponding actions. All commands shown in red are not normally 
      used in Q2 but are specific to the AQ2 mod.</P></DIV></H5><BR>

      <DIV align=left>
      <P>In order to be successful as a cleaner you must be able to adapt. A key 
      part of this flexibility is your choice of weapons. In team play this 
      becomes even more important. Since you can only carry one unique weapon at 
      a time, it is important to decide which weapon you want. Each weapon has 
      its strong points and weak points and choosing the right weapon for the 
      job can be the difference between life and death. We particularly stress 
      the importance of learning the Mk23 (pistol) and the SOG-37 (knife). The 
      reason being you will always start with these two weapons at your 
      disposal.</P></DIV></H5>

      weapon is extremely useful at close to middle ranges. It has enough power 
      to kill instantly at close range and often only one or two shots are 
      needed to kill at medium range. The shotgun can kill a target wearing 
      kevlar with a shot to the chest as easily as an unarmored target. At long 
      ranges this weapon proves less and less effective, doing little more than 
      startling or angering your opponent. It is important to note that this 
      weapon must be reloaded one shell at a time which takes time so use 
      caution when choosing to reload this weapon.<BR><BR><FONT

      <P>In addition to one unique weapon you may also carry one unique item. 
      These items can help you in a variety of different ways and should not be 
      over looked. Some combinations of weapons and items can give you (or your

      <DIV align=left>Once you feel you have a reasonable config it is time to 
      work on tactics. In basic tactics you will learn defensive and offensive 
      strategy for situations you are likely to encounter on a regular basis. 
      These lessons are not to be learned. You are to make them reflex, part of 
      your natural instinct. If you have to stop and "decide" what you want to 
      do next you are wasting time. Forethought and planning is good but it is 
      reflex and reaction that will aid you most in a tight 
      situation.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>
      <H4>
      <DIV align=center><FONT color=#ffffff>DEFENSE</FONT></DIV></H4><BR>
      <H5>
      <DIV align=left>An important thing to remember is how easy it is to kill 
      an opponent. Normally only a single shot to the head is required to down 
      someone. In the chest no more than a handful of rounds will prove fatal. 
      Even a shot to the legs can effectively impair a target, making him easy 
      pickings. Another thing to remember is someone falling a long distance 
      will often die or be injured greatly by the impact. Now that you begin to 
      understand how vulnerable your opponent is realize that you to are just as 
      vulnerable. If you find yourself being fired upon or wounded you have only 
      three choices. First, you can move out of your attacker’s line of fire; 
      you can neutralize the threat before you are killed; and the third choice, 
      lets just say let’s just say is not very productive or comfortable. On the 
      other hand our missions are more important than any one person, and there 
      may be a time when you must make the ultimate sacrifice.<BR><BR>After an 
      encounter with the enemy you may need to bandage and or reload/change your 
      weapon. Once a target is down, do not assume that you are safe. Gunfights 
      tend to draw the attention of others, just as others gunfights should draw 
      your attention. Once your target is down quickly scan the area and listen 
      for other threats. If you believe you have some semblance of safety go 
      ahead and bandage or reload.<BR><BR>When doing so try to find an area 
      where possible threats have limited access to you or obstructed views. 
      This is of course not always possible in the heat of battle. It is often 
      necessary to reload in the middle of a shoot out. If you have other 
      weapons at your disposal you must way the advantage of possibly switching 
      or dropping your current weapon in favor of another. If wounded, and you 
      feel it is not possible to neutralize the threat before bandaging you have 
      a very risky situation to deal with. While bandaging your first objective 
      should be to elude or find cover from your attacker. When doing this you 
      should be sure to move erratically, a predictable target is a hit target. 
      If possible try to see if the threat is in pursuit by running backwards or 
      ducking sharply around corners. Closing doors behind you is also an 
      effective way to impede your pursuer. At the least you should hear him 
      open the door behind you.<BR><BR>Even while bandaging or reloading you are 
      not totally defenseless. Unarmed combat while not as quick as a bullet or 
      knives can still be effective. A well-placed jump kick can send your 
      target sprawling or even disarm them. Because of falling damage, kicking 
      someone off an elevated area can be just as fatal as a gunshot to the 
      head. You should keep this in mind while being pursued and while chasing 
      your intended target.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>

      <H5>
      <DIV align=left>Now that you have read how to handle a threat while at a 
      disadvantage I will discuss the preferred method or dealing with a target. 
      The best way to assure you will not be killed or injured by an adversary 
      is to kill them as quickly as possible, preferably without them having a 
      chance to retaliate.<BR><BR>The best thing to learn is to aim for your 
      target’s head. The benefits of doing so are they will more often than not 
      die instantly, you will use less ammo and you needn’t worry that they may 
      be wearing kevlar (see equipment). The down side of this tactic is the 
      head is a much smaller target to hit in comparison with the rest of the 
      body. <BR><BR>Shooting someone in the chest is easier and often just as 
      effective. A chest shot will, depending on the kick of the weapon, knock 
      the target back slightly and momentarily throw off their aim. Depending on 
      the weapon, hitting someone in the chest can often kill almost as fast as 
      a shot to the head but in general it is much easier to survive a bullet in 
      the chest than a bullet in the brain. One other thing to consider is a 
      kevlar vest may armor your target. If so many of the weapons at your 
      disposal will become almost completely infective. If you notice a spark 
      when you shoot someone in the chest (and a message saying, "aim for the 
      head") you must aim either at their head or legs if you wish to do more 
      than bruise them.<BR><BR>Aiming for the legs of a target can also be a 
      successful strategy. By hitting someone in the legs you not only cause 
      them to start bleeding but you also decrease their speed and ability to 
      jump. This can make it much easier to follow and catch a target. You 
      should be aware however that if still a target with a leg injury is still 
      quite accurate.<BR><BR>Accuracy is a very important part of offence, 
      perhaps the most important. In AQ2 your accuracy is greatly affected by 
      various thing. You are least accurate while running back and forth or 
      jumping but you are also more difficult to hit. Walking makes you 
      considerably more accurate and has the added benefit of making little or 
      no footfall noise, the trade off is it is easier for an opponent to sight 
      or close in on you. Crouching will make you the most precise but you not 
      only suffer decreased mobility, the chances are if you are hit it will be 
      in the head. The lasersight will also make you much more preciseas 
      discussed in the equipment section. You must balance the benefits against 
      the drawbacks when you decide which you wish to do.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>

      <DIV align=left>In this section we will hopefully show you some maneuvers 
      and strategies which will give you an edge in the daunting tasks that will 
      be put before you. This section will also contain some basics on aliasing 
      (programming a set of instructions as one command).<BR><BR>One thing many 
      people overlook is how much your attitude can affect your ability to 
      succeed. Worrying or complaining about a situation or individual does 
      nothing to solve the problem. Some people will have a distinct advantage 
      over you; it’s a fact. Sometimes this is skill, sometimes better 
      resources; they may even gain their advantage unfairly. Does this mean you 
      should give up as soon as you lose the upper hand? If you believe so you 
      shouldn’t even be here. If you believe everyone is beneath you, the threat 
      behind you will often go unnoticed. On the other hand if you believe you 
      have no chance to succeed against a foe, that goal is indeed 
      unattainable.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>

      <H5>
      <DIV align=left>The first obstacle we will discuss is a threat many seem 
      to worry about. It may not be the best strategy or even the hardest to 
      overcome, but it does seem to generate the most concern. As you may have 
      guessed I am referring to the sniper. The idea of being executed by an 
      unseen or extremely well covered individual is disturbing to be sure. As 
      unpleasant as this is, it is almost sure to happen from time to time. 
      While you will never be "safe" from this there are certain precautions 
      that can be taken to increase your odds. If you believe you are in an area 
      where a sniper may have a clean shot at you the first thing to do is look 
      for cover. This can be hard cover or even a shadow. You should also take 
      care not move in a way, which would make it easy for some one to lead you, 
      making it that much easier to kill you.<BR><BR>If you happen to be fired 
      upon by a sniper and he is unfortunate enough to miss, you should try to 
      discover his location as quickly as possible. Ninety percent of the time 
      if a sniper has a clean shot at you, you also have one at him. If he 
      happens to have the silencer as well, not only can the terrain mask his 
      position but the shadows will also provide him with added security. 
      Assuming you do locate them, you have two options. You can fire at their 
      location from where you are. This can work even if the odds of hitting the 
      sniper are slim. They don’t know how good of a shot you are and only the 
      most cool headed of snipers can remain in position to take a shot when a 
      hail of lead is directed their way. The other option is to attempt to 
      close in. Close combat is often, but not always, the weakness of a sniper. 
      Another characteristic of the sniper, which can be exploited, is their 
      concentration on their fire zone. Often it is possible to approach a 
      sniper from the rear without being noticed. Using the slippers or even 
      walking will give you a large advantage when attempting this.<BR><BR>Worst 
      case scenario, despite all precautions you are shot and/or killed by a 
      sniper. If you are shot the blood trails leaving your body will betray the 
      location of the shooter. This is only useful if you can manage to stay 
      calm while your blood is spilling to the ground, not something 
      particularly easy to do. If killed, at least in deathmatch, your view will 
      immediately change to face your killer. While they did win that particular 
      encounter you now have an additional advantage for your next encounter, 
      assuming they are foolish or cocky enough to hold position. When you have 
      discovered a sniper who stays in position, even when it is obvious that 
      their location is known, you should have the upper hand. Sooner or later, 
      unless renewable ammo is close at hand, the sniper must give up his 
      location. If the location does have ammo readily available you can’t just 
      outwait your opponent. More often than not you can access their location 
      and have a fair chance to deal with them up close and personal. Now let’s 
      say that your target not only has a supply of ammo, but also has a well 
      defended, limited access position. The only other factor that may help you 
      is the ROF of their weapon. This is normally not a worthwhile gamble 
      unless they have poor aim. You do have one last option. This is perhaps 
      the hardest tactic for most of us. Leave. Just stay away from the sniper’s 
      kill zone. If a sniper doesn’t have a steady flow of targets they will 
      inevitably become frustrated to the point of leaving the safety of their 
      location.<BR><BR>Now let’s turn this around. You have found yourself in a 
      situation where a combination of your current equipment and a particular 
      location offers you a high chance of success. If you are thinking of a 
      spawn point you are a camper not a sniper. There is no skill involved is 
      shooting a defenseless target before they have a chance to react. This 
      does nothing but ruin the game for others. And in the long term for you as 
      well.<BR><BR>When you are in position you must remember that everything 
      you would do to counter a sniper, will now be used to combat you. If you 
      fire your gun will give off a muzzle flash and make enough noise to 
      attract the attention of others. If you have the silencer you have only to 
      worry about them hearing a missed shot or hearing you reloading (changing 
      weapons or modes of a weapon also makes noise). Now let’s say you are in a 
      location that would be difficult for someone to spot or see into and that 
      you are being relatively quiet. You should next ask yourself if this is a 
      high traffic location. If this is the case sticking around for any 
      extended period of time is probably a bad idea. Assuming that the odds are 
      against anyone "accidentally" happening upon your location are slim, you 
      need only worry about the person you just killed or shot. As discussed 
      above this will often give away your position to anyone who is spending 
      more time trying to play the game rather than whine about how "unfair" it 
      is.<BR><BR>One tactic with the sniper rifle (which may be riskier than it 
      is worth) is to shoot your target in the lower body or legs. This may seem 
      stupid, because it won’t kill them instantly and it may even be possible 
      for them to survive such an attack, but more often than not it will stile 
      prove fatal. Why bother? The benefit of this tricky tactic is that if they 
      manage to limp some distance away before dying your shot will not betray 
      your position when they finally do die. It is even more important when 
      trying this to have the silencer than when trying for a certain kill. Also 
      a weary opponent may be able to determine your location by the direction 
      of the blood spray from his body. While the fallbacks to this strategy are 
      great knowing that your opponent was killed and has no idea where his 
      killer was can be is very satisfying.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>

      <DIV align=center><FONT color=#ffffff>CAMPERS</FONT></DIV></H4><BR>
      <H5>
      <DIV align=left>The weaker less skilled brethren to the sniper, the camper 
      is far less of a threat. We categorize the camper as someone who returns 
      to the same location again and again feeling that it offers them a place 
      from which to get repeated kills without the threat of retaliation. 
      Favorite locations for these types of players* are spawning points. This 
      allows them to fire on a target before they have time to react or even 
      move in many cases. This often results in the camper racking up more than 
      a few kills. Unfortunately this type of play tends to decrease the 
      enjoyment of everyone involved. Some campers are either concerned only for 
      their enjoyment alone or actually enjoy tormenting others.<BR><BR>The main 
      drawback of this strategy is you accumulate points without showing any 
      amount of skill. Even if you have no problem with this, the odds are the 
      bulk of the other players will. The slight advantage you gain by this type 
      of cowardice quickly disappears when everyone involved decides to make you 
      public enemy number one. If someone even has the slightest inclination 
      that you might be spawn camping they will often stop what they are doing 
      and go directly to where they believe you are. <BR><BR>Of course in team 
      play the rules differ a little and the line between sniper and camper 
      becomes even more blurred. Because of limited ammo, and the fact that 
      respawning is not an issue, this type of camping doesn’t really exist in 
      team play.<BR><BR>*We consider this to be a type of player rather than a 
      strategy, because most using these tactics tend to use them 
      exclusively.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>
      <H4>
      <DIV align=center><FONT color=#ffffff>GRENADIERS</FONT></DIV></H4><BR>
      <H5>
      <DIV align=left>The grenade while not necessarily the best weapon does 
      have the most potential damage with a single attack. The large blast 
      pattern and the extreme damage incurred by any caught in or around it 
      makes getting kills with a grenade far from the most difficult of tasks. 
      In fact probably the most difficult thing about using the grenade is 
      insuring your safety between the time you pull the pin and it’s 
      detonation. The most obvious way to use a grenade is to find the most 
      crowded area, which happens to be reasonably contained and lob one right 
      in the middle. This will often yield multiple kills and those who do make 
      it out may not look back.<BR><BR>Another use of the grenade is the high 
      percentage throw. Some people will often find a location where they have a 
      renewable supply of grenades and simply toss them at areas, which have a 
      good chance of being populated. This takes place most often on rooftops 
      where the grenadier will throw to the ground below without any indication 
      of a target being present. On a large map or one with few potential 
      targets this is not a very practical strategy. On a very crowded map 
      however this can prove to be quite successful. Often this is not a luxury 
      that is available.<BR><BR>In order to use the grenade successfully you 
      must first be able to put it exactly where you want. This can prove to be 
      much more difficult than aiming a gun. This is because a grenade flies in 
      an arced path, will bounce off the ground or walls, can only be thrown so 
      far and has a delay before explosion. On the other hand the large area of 
      effectiveness, at the time of detonation, can considerably make up for 
      missing the intended target zone. These "drawbacks" can also be used to 
      your advantage with practice.<BR><BR>The arced path can be used to lob the 
      grenade over obstacles. The bounce can be used to place a grenade around a 
      corner or into a room without exposing yourself. The delay can be overcome 
      by predicting where your target(s) will be at the time of detonation. One 
      more thing to consider is that you needn’t kill with the explosion for the 
      grenade to be effective. When a smart player hears a grenade rattle to the 
      ground nearby he will try to get to the closest "safe" place. If you can 
      predict where this might be you can herd your target into position for an 
      easy kill.<BR><BR>On a more morbid note you should remember that the 
      grenades only detonate after the spoon is released. The pin can be out 
      indefinitely but the spoon remains in place until the grenade is thrown or 
      dropped. If you are killed while holding a grenade (after pulling the pin) 
      it will tumble to the ground and detonate. Keep your eyes open because 
      many people will exploit this and make suicide runs when they feel no 
      other option is available.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>

      <H5>
      <DIV align=left>In order to neutralize multiple targets without taking 
      heavy losses it is important to be aware of what is taking place around 
      you. This means keeping your eyes and ears open at all times. Watching the 
      screen for movement and muzzle flashes is fairly easy for most but many 
      forget to listen. With the help of stereo speakers or headphones you will 
      often hear an opponent before you see them. Listening for doors and 
      splashing can also be helpful if you know the map well enough. Because of 
      this you should keep in mind that others may be listening for you. Because 
      of this the stealth slippers or walking should not always be 
      overlooked.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>

      <DIV align=center><FONT color=#ffffff>ALIASING</FONT></DIV></H4><BR>
      <H5>
      <DIV align=left>The binding of commands covered in the bindings section is 
      just the start of how the client side of quake can be modified. By using 
      aliasing you can simplify groups of commands or string a set of commands 
      together as one. This can be used create toggles or simply to cut down on 
      typing.<BR><BR>The console command for creating an alias is 
      simple.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ffffff>alias name 
      "command(s)"</FONT><BR><BR>Where name is the name of the alias, and 
      command is any one or multiple command lines. If multiple commands are 
      used a semicolon (;) must be used to separate them. You can then bind a 
      key or button to the name of the alias like you would any other 
      command.<BR>To create a toggle you will need to make two 
      aliases.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ffffff>alias name1 "command;bind key1 
      name2)"</FONT><BR><FONT color=#ffffff>alias name2 "command;bind key2 
      name1)"</FONT><BR><BR>Where name1 is the name of the first alias, command 
      is the first command you want the key to execute, key1 is the key or 
      button you want the command to be bound to. Name2 is the name of the 
      second part of the alias (after you have hit it once), command is the 
      command you want the key to execute on the second press, key2 will be the 
      same key or button as key1. What this does is execute the command and bind 
      the key used to a second command. Then on the second press it executes 
      that command and is bound back to the original command.<BR>As a final step 
      you must bind a key to the alias you created.<BR><BR><FONT 
      color=#ffffff>bind key name</FONT><BR><BR>Where key is the key or button 
      you want to execute the alias. (If you are making a toggle it is important 
      to use the same key as you did within your alias) and name is the name of 
      the alias.<BR>Below is an example and an explanation on what it 
      does.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ffffff>alias walk "set cl_run 0;bind END 
      run"</FONT><BR><FONT color=#ffffff>alias run "set cl_run 1;bind END 
      walk"</FONT><BR><FONT color=#ffffff>bind END "walk"</FONT><BR><BR>This 
      alias bind’s the <FONT color=#ffffff>end</FONT> key to become a toggle 
      between always run on and always run off.<BR><BR>This is just one example 
      of what can be done with aliases.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>

      <DIV align=left>Several guides have been written by various players on the 
      technique of sniping. However, I think it has been assumed incorrectly 
      that all players have learned the basics of close combat melee. Close 
      combat melee refers to any fight involving two or more people in combat at 
      once, like circle strafing in the streets or ducking and weaving behind 
      obstacles on the rooftops or in hallways. Close combat melee is when you 
      can see the details on the enemies face. There are a couple of different 
      items you want to keep in mind when attempting to mix it up at close range 
      like this.<BR><BR>Several guides have been written by various players on

      items you want to keep in mind when attempting to mix it up at close range 
      like this.<BR><BR>Right about here is where I get complaints about LPB's. 
      You can help offset the advantage an LPB has when you learn how you can 
      compensate for it. To hit those nasty low pingers you will need to aim in 
      front of them. Yeah, McDizzo, but how far? Simple... aim ahead by an 
      amount equal to the distance the enemy can move in the meantime. If your 
      ping is only off by a hundred milliseconds or so you probably won't notice 
      much difference. But a target can move quite a bit in 300 milliseconds. 
      You just aim where the enemy will be when your laggy bullets get there. If 
      that's confusing, listen to your gut and aim there.<BR><BR>With regards to 
      aim, the sweet shot is the head of course, but don't forget that a couple 
      of MK23 rounds in the chest will fell an opponent as well. Pick your 
      targets; if you know who you are going to shoot it makes it a lot easier 
      to actually hit him. This is the hard part because there are a bunch of 
      other folks gunning for you too.<BR><BR>Next on the list is your choice of 
      weapon. <B><I><U>Important:</U></I></B> depending on the weapon that you 
      are using your movement and target may change slightly. This happens 
      because some weapons are not well suited for melee combat. The best melee 
      weapons are close range weapons. As I said earlier, close range is any 
      distance where you can see the details of the players face. I suppose the 
      best way to illustrate this is to do a little run down of the weapons, so 
      here goes (you can click the header for an example):<BR><BR>
      <H4>
      <DIV align=center><FONT color=#ffffff><A

      Weapons</A>:</FONT></DIV></H4><BR>
      <H5>
      <DIV align=left><FONT color=#ffffff>SSG 3000 Sniper Rifle</FONT> - The 
      sniper rifle is a long range weapon. This is a gun that is not to be used 
      in close combat unless you are out of everything else and have thrown away 
      your knife. It is very inaccurate off the hip (unzoomed) and you will end 
      up dead more often than not if you try to use this close 
      quarters.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>

      <H5>
      <DIV align=left><FONT color=#ffffff>Mp5 Submachine gun</FONT> - This is a 
      mid-range weapon because of the light nature of the ammunition. Even in 
      the chest it will take at least three rounds to kill a target. This is a 
      weapon that gets abused by many trying to use it from an exceptional 
      distance; the Mp5 is not a sniping weapon. Also, if you are going to run 
      and shoot with this weapon, you can start looking for a different guy to 
      kill; more often then not you will be respawning soon. (Note: Kevlar will 
      stop this weapon cold. Take care to get at least one head shot in, or you 
      will become the victim.)<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>M4 Assault Rifle</FONT> - 
      Do not overlook the amazing stopping power that this gun has. I enjoy 
      mowing down a target as much as the next guy, but it is not a sniper 
      rifle, it is not a handgun, it is an assault rifle and must be used as 
      such. To use this weapon you need to be a little distance away and just 
      let loose with a volley. Its a good idea to use the "weapon" command so 
      that it shoots in the more accurate 3-round burst as opposed to just 
      emptying the entire clip into your target. This firearm uses a lot of ammo 
      very quickly so it is important to control it. Trying to use this gun in a 
      close combat situation will frustrate you, because while you are moving it 
      jumps all over the place and it rides up due to recoil. Definitely a plant 
      and shoot weapon, at least if you wish to use it effectively.<BR><FONT 
      color=#ffffff>M3 Super 90 Assault Shotgun</FONT> - I place this weapon in 
      the mid-range category for one important reason. If you are going to be 
      using the shotgun in close combat, and are swinging the gun about trying 
      to hit a target you will not have as good a chance of actually hitting 
      your target. Yes, this will kill them instantly if taken point blank, but 
      that isn't the point of a shotgun, now is it? Pepper the quarry from a few 
      paces out and you will see much better results in the way of blood, and 
      blinding the opponent. The point is to stay alive and kill the enemy. 
      Firing from a slight distance is much better because it forces the other 
      guy to make the better shot, you can cover more area. You have the 
      advantage with this weapon.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>

      <DIV align=center><FONT color=#ffffff><A

      <H5>
      <DIV align=left><FONT color=#ffffff>Handcannon</FONT> - I have very little 
      to say about this gun. The reload is slow, so pull the trigger point 
      blank. Sure, it can be used to blind or damage your opponent a great deal, 
      but the charm of the gun is in the raw power. Sneak up to your target with 
      the slippers and POW! No more opponent.<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>Akimbo 
      Pistols</FONT> - This is a personal favorite. They can be used at any 
      range. You can just plant firmly in the chest or head and pull the 
      trigger, or stand on a building and try to snipe. A big mess later you 
      will have a frag. They are relatively easy to use both standing still and 
      while running. These are carnage machines. A really good way to go is to 
      get a bandolier and gather ammo, or go into tank mode with the 
      Kevlar.<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>MK23 Pistol</FONT> - I believe this to be 
      the most effective weapon at any range. Another big bonus of the MK23 is 
      the fact that the accuracy is not significantly impacted by movement. If 
      you can learn to use this gun the rest of the game becomes a lot 
      easier.<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>SOG-37 Knife</FONT> - The knife is 
      available to throw and for use as a slashing weapon. Ordinarily used as a 
      last resort, I am aware of a few players who can do really great things 
      with this blade right off the bat. You must be point blank in their face 
      and keep slashing. Always go for the chest and head. If you can slash out 
      a leg, or shoot them in the legs first, it is easier to track them down 
      and cut them from behind. To use the thrown version effectively, all I can 
      say is practice. The knife has a definite curve (due to gravity) and 
      accuracy can only come with practice. If you do hit your target, the 
      thrown knife does damage equivalent to the sniper rifle. A good skill to 
      have. You can carry 10 knives, 20 with a Bandolier.<BR><FONT 
      color=#ffffff>Boot to the head</FONT> - I almost forgot that when all else 
      fails, or even just for fun, a swift kick can be a very effective weapon. 
      You can jump on top of their head and crouch there for repeat damage or 
      kick peeps off of high places for a satisfying crunch. If you are out of 
      ammo, and you don't like the knifes try to kick them. To execute a kick 
      you must be right next to them and jump, that's it.<BR><BR>That about 
      covers the weapons and the uses and ranges and such. You can pair up with 
      different items depending on the map you're fragging on. Use a silencer 
      for dark areas, the laser sight if you are unsure of your aim. The only 
      item I really didn't cover was the grenades. Use Frag Grenades in 
      situations where there are large volumes of combatants, or to reach a hard 
      to shoot place. The middle of a big gun battle is also a good bet. Look at 
      where peeps are moving to figure out where to throw, and use the "weapon" 
      command to choose the effective distance you need to throw it. Give 
      yourself lots of room when you throw one; it is just as deadly to you as 
      it is to the other players.<BR><BR>In essence, you just need to remember 
      three things; Move, Think, Practice. Not everything I have said here will 
      work for you. It might even be totally against your style. Experiment with 
      combinations of weapons and items in a variety of situations, and above 
      all have fun.</DIV></H5><BR><BR>
