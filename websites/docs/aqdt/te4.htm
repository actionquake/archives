   <P><H5>What's Different from AQ2 1.52?</H5></P>

<P>AQ:ETE 4.4 can run in "normal" deathmatch and teamplay modes, just like the original AQ 1.52 from the A-Team.  When running in these modes there are some differences.  Keep in mind the gameplay is unchanged, these are mainly added features.  No weapon strength or accuracy has been changed, no blanace issues have been changed.  AQ:ETE keeps the original weapon and item balance intact by design--its goal is not to "tweak" the gameplay but to enhance the capabilities.</P>

<P>Here are the major differences:</P>

<UL>
<LI>AQ:ETE has m4 script detection, logging, and kicking, AQ 1.52 does not
<LI>AQ:ETE has the $$ skin crash exploit fixed, AQ 1.52 does not
<LI>AQ:ETE has the weapon farming crash exploit fixed, AQ 1.52 does not
<LI>AQ:ETE has the infinite ammo cheat fixed, AQ 1.52 does not
<LI>AQ:ETE has support for %L and %S location commands, AQ 1.52 does not
<LI>AQ:ETE allows the server admin to disable frag-denying suicides before death, AQ 1.52 does not
<LI>If someone suicides to deny you a frag, AQ:ETE gives it to you anyway, AQ 1.52 does not
<LI>AQ:ETE allows you to forgive your friend if he TK's you so he's not banned, AQ 1.52 does not
<LI>AQ:ETE supports/forces LowLag sounds to be used by the players, AQ 1.52 does not
<LI>AQ:ETE integrates the unreleased AQ 1.53 code, AQ 1.52 does not (duh)
</UL>

<P>Some things to note:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Weapon balance is unchanged, the accuracy, strength, speed, and spread is the same
<LI>Item balance is unchanged, the items do the same things, same accuracy for laser site
<LI>AQ:ETE can be run in "normal" mode and <I>never</I> even switched to TE or Espionage modes, if desired
<LI>AQ:ETE can generally be considered a base "upgrade" to AQ 1.52
</UL>

<P>Well, those are the major differences.  Some are transparent and you'll never know they are there.  Some are additional features and commands.  One is the LowLag sounds that everyone is forced to use, though for their own good.</P>
