<PRE>
v4.3c

 * Removed some debug messages
 * Added cvar 'e_maxVolunteers'

v4.3

 * Made several cvars _not_ serverinfo (to fix "info string length exceeded")

 * Added # of subs to scoreboard 1 frags/players summary line
 * Added team info to scoreboard 2 with indicators for captain, sub, and referee
 * Fixed not being able to pick up briefcase
 * Added OFFSET directive to TARGET_AREA so you can place the area's model 
    somewhere other than the center of the box
   - Specified as a vector relative to the center
   - Only valid when TARGET_AREA has a MODEL
   - e.g., to lower the key model 10 units:
       TARGET_AREA "A" ( 0 0 0 ) ( 10 15 10 ) 
       MODEL "models/items/keys/red_key/tris.md2" OFFSET ( 0 0 -10 )

v4.2

 * Added %S for line of sight location reporting
 * Added support for ML-style location files
   - Works with scripts 0 or 1
   - looks for file called action/ml/&lt;mapname>.aqg
   - TARGET_AREA and TARGET_FLAGSPAWN locations take precedence
   - location files can be found at: 
     <A HREF="http://www.algonet.se/~ml2/action/ml/downloads.html">http://www.algonet.se/~ml2/action/ml/downloads.html</A>
   - Be careful of filename case on Linux (e.g. BLOCKWAR.aqg)

     #  1024 Silencer
     #  2048 Bandolier
     #  4096 Laser
   - e.g., to ban M4, HC, Akimbo, and Vest: 
      weaponBan = 1 + 4 + 32 + 256 = 293
 * Added cvars "e_useDefaultScenario" and "e_defaultScenarioName" for
     default scenario support
   - Requires scripts 1
   - e_useDefaultScenario:
     # 0 - default to normal teamplay for maps where a scenario can't be found
     # 1 - use scenario specified in e_defaultScenarioName if a scenario can't 
             be found
     # 2 - use default scenario for all maps
     # 3 - use default scenario on maps in action.ini instead of action.scp
   - e.g., to default to ATL on maps without scenarios
     # e_defaultScenarioName "Assassinate The Leader"
     # e_useDefaultScenario 1

      names and coordinates of interesting landmarks, e.g.

 * Modified the frag bonus structure
   - A player gets frag bonuses if either he or his victim are near
     something interesting

     carriers, and special players (TARGET_PLAYER_*)

v3.0f

v3.0e

 * Tweaked parser output to match input - should make debugging scripts easier
 * Added INITIAL_SPAWN directive
 * Fixed TIME chasecam bug
 * Changed 'scripts' cvar to not be SERVERINFO
 * Added HUD display for % dead or time remaining until spawn 
   (only visible while dead)

v3.0d

 * Captures are based on whether BC is "tagged" as being home or not,
    instead of how far it is from home (capture points too high above
    the floor made captures impossible)
 * Dead players under FRACTION or TIME respawn can now chasecam
 * New players may now spawn into a game in progress as soon as they 
   join a team
   - if the team has TIME or INSTANT respawn, the new player spawns immediately

                 INSTANT or
                 FRACTION &lt;%> or 
                 TIME &lt;secs>
       &lt;location> is (null - defaults to RANDOM_SPAWN) or
                     INITIAL_SPAWN or
                     RANDOM_SPAWN

 * Added MODEL directive to TARGET_AREA
    e.g.   TARGET_AREA "The Head" (-50, 24, -30) (-10, 64, 10) 
           MODEL "models/items/c_head/tris.md2"
