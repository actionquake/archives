
  The "grapple" variant is based off of PG BUND's AQ:Edition 

  version 1.23 and can use many of the same features and commands.  

  AQ:Grapple was created by $illy, who can be reached at 

  doze206@hotmail.com.  He integrated and tweaked 

  the grappling hook found at the following websites:


  http://www.planetquake.com/qdevels/index.shtml

  http://www.quakefiles.com/skunkworks/q2/tutorial.html



  The only addional command that a client needs to know is to 

  bind a key to "+hook".  This should probably be mentioned 

  somewhere in the MOTD (message that shows up when someone 

  connects) so people new to the variant will know how to 

  take advantage of the grappling hook.  



  The aq2.dll file appears to be the "grapple" aq2 variant 

  the same as the gamex86.dll file.  The only difference is 

  that aq2.dll complained about camping and promptly killed 

  me off for using the grapple to stay in one place for too 

  long.  Other than that it seemed identical.  Just rename 

  files as appropriate if you wish to use the "anti-camping" 

  version.
