Action Quake 2 v 1.52/ Llama Dome 1.05

This is the first draft of a readme file for the Llama Dome
mod for Action Quake 2.  This version is based on the
AQ 2 v 1.52 source code.

Llama Dome is a server-side only mod.  It is designed to run
with any standard Action Quake 2 server.  It is also possible
to set the server settings so that this server functions
exactly like a standard AQ 2 server (so why bother running
the default when you can run this one?).

Please have a look at the Llamadome website for reasonably
up-to-date information about this modification at:

	http://www.babylon4.com/llamadome


Here is a quick summary of the major server and player
additions that are in this mod.

Server variable controls:
    hardarmor 0/1  	- 0 kevlar vest will allow bruising damage
		   	  1 kevlar vest stops all chest damage

    gunmode 0/1    	- 0 guns operate in standard AQ 1.51 mode
			  1 sets a more realistic scatter model that
        	            is tunable via cvars (see dmguns.cfg).
			    Also the M4 can be silenced and the MP5
			    will kick up.
 
    allow_llama 0/1	- 0 do not allow players to become Llamas
                          1 enable the player command "llamamode"

    allow_llama_items 0/1 - 0 do not spawn the extra "llama" items
                            1 do spawn the llama items
			      (the only llama item in 1.05 is the Ninja/Berserk)
 
    allow_farming 0/1	- 0 do not allow grenade farming
                          1 allow grenade farming (I had requests...)

    stathud 0/1		- 0 display standard AQ HUDs
			  1 display HUD with extra statistics and high scores
 
There are also a lot of variables in the file "dmguns.cfg" that are
used to tune the scatter patterns of the guns when your server is
in "gunmode 1".
 
 
Player commands:
    commands     - lists all avaliable commands
 
    highscore    - shows the current high scores
 
    stats        - partially implemented.  It will report the
		   statistics about how well you are shooting.
		   Nominally will report number of shots per
		   gun, number of hits, number of kills, etc.
		   Server is not recording this data yet, but
		   will in Llamadome 1.06.

    timeleft     - tells you how much time is left on a level in
                   HH:MM:SS mode (prints to the console or to the
                   top of your screen if you bind a key)
 
    llamamode    - kills the player and moves him/her into or
                   out of Llama mode.  You get 10 knives and
		   can only use the knife an the pistol (though
		   you can still carry a special weapon and pick
		   up ammo).
