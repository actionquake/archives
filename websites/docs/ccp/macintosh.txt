  Please read the _docinfo.txt file in the "action/docs/" folder.

  Please read the layout.txt and pak1.txt files in the "action/" folder.

  Please read the _maplist.txt file in the "action/maps/docs/" folder.

  Macintosh servers are available in the "action/servers" folder.



  For specific information on installing Action Quake 2 on a Macintosh, 

  Please refer to the following websites:

  http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/games/actionquake/ (Action Quake instructions)

  http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/games/  (General Macintosh gaming guides)



  In addition, you may need to get Stuffit or an alternative unzipping program from:

  http://mac.tucows.com/  (ShareWare/FreeWare Macintosh utilities and applications)

  Stuffit has sometimes been reported to corrupt the PAK files in the ZIPs.  

  If you have problems with missing or corrupt files, this may be the case.  



  Action Quake 2 has been confirmed to WORK on a Blue and White G3/300.  I know.  

  I helped set it up.  :)  If you run into problems with Quake 2 itself, then you 

  can get the update to the latest version (which may include bug fixes) here:

  ftp://ftp.logicware.com/pub/quake2/



  Macintosh users can run a server themselves.  You may use the included server 

  files or download the ones at http://railgun.macquakeinfinity.com/.



  Since Action Quake 2 is primarily an online game, you may want to be 

  able to SEARCH for online games, right?

  The last bit of information is about an error you may receive.  

  It will be a scrolling error message stating something like, 

  "cannot find ../player/male/resdog_i.pcx".

  These errors are caused by not having the little tumbnail picture 

  of the player's face when you do a player listing while playing.  

  The solution is relatively simple:



  1. Check your Multiplayer settings and make sure you're set to auto-download skins.  

  2. Reconnect to the server, see if Quake 2 downloads the needed files.  

     This will be shown in the console as the map loads--watch carefully.  

     You will STILL get the error message at this point so continue on to 

     the next step.  Make note of the error message(s).

  3. Exit Quake 2 and look in 

     Quake2 > action > players > [model name] > [skin name]_i.pcx

  4. If this file is NOT present, i.e. the server did not allow you to download 

     the file, then try going to the Guild and finding the missing skin.

  5. Once you have the file, copy ONLY the [skin name]_i.pcx file into the 

     Quake2 > action > pics folder.  

  6. If you are unable to obtain this skin, then you can still get rid 

     of the error messages.  Copy any other pair of [skin name].pcx and 

     [skin name]_i.pcx files in the same model directory (such as "male" 

     or "aqmarine") and then rename them to the requested file names.  

     Now copy the [skin name]_i.pcx file that you just made into the 

     Quake2 > action > pics folder.  The skin will look the same as one 

     of the skins you alread have BUT at least the errors will stop spamming 

     you--and you'll be able to read what other people are saying!  :)
