  Linux users, setting up Action Quake 2 is easy... as long as you have 

  Quake 2 working properly.  :)  Once Quake 2 is working properly all you 

  should need to do is to install this Action Quake 2 package and you should 

  be good to go.

  "Running AQ2 isn't the difficult step.  The difficult step is getting 

  Quake 2 to work.  Note: Xfree86 4 *isn't* required."  -- Lt. Hawkins



  To get Action Quake working, you will invoke it somewhat like this:

  /usr/local/games/quake2/quake2 +set game action
