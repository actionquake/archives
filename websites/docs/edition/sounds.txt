HOW TO USE THE SOUNDS
---------------------

1. Create a dir named "user" within your action/sound directory.
2. Copy all sounds to this directory.
3. Copy sndlist.ini into your action directory 
   (if you allready use a sndlist.ini, add all new sounds to it)
4. Enable download options for clients
5. Let your clients know, that new sounds are available

Done! :)
