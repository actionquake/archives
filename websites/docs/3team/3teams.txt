3-Teams for ActionQuake2 1.5h
------------------------------------------
Features:
-3 Teams in one level (works just like normal Teamplay, only 2 teams need players to start gaming)
-New item: Helmet (Protects head somewhat well, not from sniper or knives ;)
-M4 cant get Lasersight, but it is a bit more accurate than before without it.
-Lasersight doesn't help so much when running as it did before
-Game will begin if just two of the 3 teams have players.
-Shotgun & Handcannon now check where you hit.(Removed for now, caused a stupid bug, fill be fixed)
-Helmet works in DM too without modifying maps. (aq2 feature :)
-If there were 3 teams but one gets empty, its score will be put back to 0 
-Message when you shoot enemy to HELMET.
-Random round win messages.
-Set smallteam 1/0 variable (configures whether people are forced to join the team with least number of players or not(1 is on, defaults to 0)

Coming:
-Better model&pic for helmet, when i find some :)
-Something else I find interesting :-) (maybe defineable weapon banning?)

How to get it work(win95/NT):

1. Backup your original gamex86.dll from quake2\action directory
2. Unzip the gamex86.dll from 3TeamAQ.zip to your quake2\action directory
3. Edit your action.ini and add there [team3], its name, and used model&skin just the same way as team1 and team2 are configured.
4. Get some buddys to play with and start fragging!
