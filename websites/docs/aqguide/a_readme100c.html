 Introduction to Action Quake<BR>
 ----------------------------<BR>
 Welcome to Action Quake2. This program will allow you to access
 any Action Quake2 servers running the same client version (1.0+).<BR>
 <BR>
 Action Quake2 is a DM mod designed along the lines of a good action
 movie.  No BFGs or rapid fire rocket launchers here,  and not a plasma weapon or laser 
 gun in sight.  What we DO have is a mod where stealth and strategy pay off more 
 than the ability to shoot yourself in the feet with a BFG.<BR>
 <BR>
 Installation<BR>
 ------------<BR>
 Simple as can be. Install into X:\quake2\action, as you would with any other mod.<BR>
 <BR>
 Basics<BR>
 ------<BR>
 In Action Quake2 you start with only a pistol and 12 bullets in the
 clip.  In most games your starting weapon is little more than a glorified pea-shooter, 
 not in this mod.  That's a Mk23, more than enough to lay down a foe, 
 plus stopping power to boot.  Locational damage also insures that those shots to 
 the head will get you a kill.  But be careful with those shots, ammo is sparse
 compared to what you might be used to and you can hold only so much.  When running your 
 accuracy drops dramatically, so stand still when lining up for that head-shot.<BR>
 <BR>
 So now you've taken a jaunt through the level and are wondering where
 the other weapons are. 'This pistol is nice, but I want a shotgun.' you may be thinking.  
 Well, in Action Quake2, weapons are unique, this means that if you see
 someone running through the level with an MP5, that's the only MP5 on
 the level.  So shoot the guy and take it, you've earned it.  You can only 
 carry one unique item at a time.  Of course, special items function in the same way.  The 
 teamplay variation is different, you choose your own weapon/item.  That is a whole other 
 story.<BR>
 <BR>
 In this release there are 7 weapons: the pistol, akimbo pistols, the MP5, the shotgun,
 the sniper rifle, grenades, the assault rifle, the knives, and the hand cannon.  All but
 the grenades, knives, and the pistol are considered 'unique'.  See <A HREF="a_action.html"><I><B>action.txt</B></I></A> or go to our 
 website (<A HREF="http://action.action-web.net/">http://action.action-web.net/</A>) for more details.<BR>
 <BR>
 we are very interested in player comments and suggestions.  If you like 
 the mod, tell us why.  If you hate the mod,  tell us why.  And if you have
 any ideas that you think would make a good  addition, please tell us.  
 You can write to us at ateam@telefragged.com Make sure that if you have a 
 suggestion, that you place it on our messageboard first though.  The messageboard
 can be found at <A HREF="http://www.mapzone.net/cgi/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">http://www.mapzone.net/cgi/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro<A><BR>

 Other Credits<BR>
 -------------<BR>
 Well, too many people to thank them all, really, but I would like to thank Snigglet for our status bar icons,  Nirrad for a load of web graphics, Abraxis for the grenade model, DogFaceGremlin (Pietro's little brother) for the Sabatoge skin, Cold Fusion and Cable for the slipper and box-o-shells models/skins, and shiro for our channel on EFNet (#action) and for the Mr. T skin. Also thanks to our beta testers, and to Dr Caliban for setting up a test server.  Huge thanks go to Indigosmash who runs quake.inil.com, for helping us get thru v1.0! Also, mad props to David Wright of Rocket Arena 2 for the use and help with some of the RA2 (<A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/arena/">http://www.planetquake.com/arena/</A>) source code.  Mad props to Mike Gummelt of Raven software who helped me with the code through dozens of emails.  Major thanx go to Siris who did bugfixes for v1.00c and also does our linux ports for us.  Those folks at QDevels were essential to the building of the mod, thanks.  And of course the guys at id (obligitory yes, but also sincere).  There were plenty more people who contributed to the mod, thank you so much.  And finally, thank you to the players, the ones who made this mod become what it is today.<BR>
