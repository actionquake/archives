INFO
####

	.ADF files contain information about areas of a map which can be
	used by	players in team messages to simply tell teammates their current
	position.

	These files are only necessary if you are running a server, clients
	don't need them!

	If you want to create .ADF files yourself have a look at the Action
	Quake2 Edition readme for instruction. Please send them to me so I can
	put them on the page and make them available for other server admins.
	Please notice that there is currently a limitation of 300 locations per
	file. If you need more you may contact PG BUND and ask him to increase
	them or modify and recompile the source code yourself.


INSTALLATION
############

	Just put the .ADF files in your action\location directory, the server
	will read them on every mapchange.
	For some maps there may be more than one file, just rename the one you
	want to use to MAPNAME.ADF

	I'm also creating some location files using a client side proxy. Those
	files have the extension .LOC and cannot be used by Edition servers as
	they have a different file format. I just include them here as some
	people have asked for them.
