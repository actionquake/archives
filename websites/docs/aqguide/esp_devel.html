How-To's are not available in this version of AQ:E.  How-To scenarios will 
be available in the future releases of AQ:E.  However, there are scenario 
templates.  If you know a little bit about coding, it should be incredibly 
easy to figure it out.  The templates go as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<B>ctb_with_flag_team_func_template.scn</B><BR><BR>
	-This is the template you would use to make scenarios that contain
         the info_flag_team1 and info_flag_team2 spawn functions (AQ:E uses
         those spawn points to spawn the flags<BR>
<BR>
		example maps:	blockwar, ctbcity<BR>
<BR>
<B>ctb_with_noflag_team_func_template.scn</B><BR><BR>
	-This is the template you would use to make scenarios that do NOT 
         contain info_flag_team1 and info_flag_team2 spawn functions.  This
         requires a little bit more work; any map that is out there can be
         scripted for AQ:E<BR>
<BR>
<B>etv_template.scn</B><BR><BR>
	-This is the template you would use to make scenarios for Escort 
         the VIP<BR>
<BR>
<B>ofc_template.scn</B><BR><BR>
	-This is the template you would use to make scenarios for One Flag
         Capture<BR>
<BR>
<B>atl_template.scn</B><BR><BR>
	-This is the template you would use to make scenarios for 
         Assassinate the Leader<BR>
<BR>
<B>frd_template.scn</B><BR><BR>
	-This is the template you would use to make scenarios for Find,
         Retrieve/Defend<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
**NOTE**<BR><BR>
	To find the exact location (this is needed for force-spawning stuff)
        on a map. simple go into console and type 'viewpos' it will give you
        your X, Y, and Z position. Copy those down. It should look like: <BR>
<BR>
        ( 31 -494 20 ) : 349   <BR>
<BR>
        The numbers in the parentheses are important!  Also, if you want to
        comment stuff out, simply put a // on the line you want AQ:E to 
        skip over (good for debugging).<BR>
