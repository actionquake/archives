Action Quake: Edition<BR>
Version 1.24 as of January 22, 2000<BR>
<BR>
by Ruediger Bund ("PG Bund[Rock]"), Benjamin Greiner ("=DIE=TempFile")<BR>
and Sven Herrmann ("=DIE=Woodoo").<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Changes 1.23 -> 1.24 (01/22/2000)<BR>
<BR>
* Several bug fixes<BR>
<BR>
+ sv_allowcrlf server cvar: if 0, clients are not allowed to issue CR/LF
  control characters in chat messages. This is done by proxies to hide the
  chatter's name in order to replace it with an abbreviation, e.g. in a
  clanwar, but very often misused in normal games. The default setting is 1,
  so if you want to disable the CR/LF use just set it to 0.<BR>
<BR>
+ The M4 spread has been slighty increased so there shouldn't be far too
  much headshots now.<BR>
<BR>
Changes 1.22 -> 1.23 (11/02/1999)<BR>
<BR>
+ Notification when a player changes name<BR>
<BR>
* Soundlist overflow bug fixed<BR>
<BR>
+ Server-side cvar "sv_gib" toggles gibbing, this can improve lagginess<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Changes 1.21 -> 1.22 (8/25/1999)<BR>
<BR>
* RADIO: When you survived a round, the kill count wasn't reset when the
  new round started. Led to wrong autonumbering when reporting enemyd. Fixed.<BR>
<BR>
* LCA time increased by .2 sec.<BR>
<BR>
* Fixed format string bug in kicklist and maplist commands.<BR>
<BR>
* "game type" MOTD entry always reported tourney even in normal teamplay; fixed.<BR>
<BR>
* Team kills no longer add to damage points.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Changes 1.20b2 -> 1.21 (8/17/1999)<BR>
<BR>
+ TEAMPLAY: If you kill several enemies before doing "radio enemyd", the
  number of enemies killed is prefixed to your radio message.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fixes 1.20b1 -> b2<BR>
<BR>
* Live players don't get death messages anymore if they aren't involved in the
  killing<BR>
<BR>
* Ignore Spamming is no longer possible<BR>
<BR>
* "You'll get to your weapon after bandaging" flood bug fixed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Changes 1.10 -> 1.20b1<BR>
<BR>
* Updated codebase to Action 1.52, that implies all changes done by the
  A-Team in that revision.<BR>
<BR>
* Listen servers didn't work because the local IP "loopback" was treated as 
  invalid and got banned; fixed.<BR>
<BR>
- Friendly Fire: Because this feature is now in original Action Quake, all ff-related
  cvars including banning and suicide limits were transformed to the format introduced
  by the A-Team. See the Action 1.52 <A HREF="a_versions.html">versions.txt</A> file.<BR>
<BR>
* Improved location detection<BR>
<BR>
* With a script, one was able to suppress the gun firing sound using the punch
  command; fixed.<BR>
  The way this bug was fixed also makes "punchspamming" impossible, there is now
  a .65 sec delay after each punch.<BR>
<BR>
* Locations are now defined by cubes. See adf.txt.<BR>
<BR>
- Completely dropped support for .pg files.<BR>
<BR>
* Gibbing is back for the sniper rifle! See for yourself. :)<BR>
<BR>
* Fixed smaller bugs.<BR>
<BR>
+ Emotions: If the message begins with "%me", this sequence is replaced by
  the player's name and the "name:" part is cut off, just like in IRC.
  Note that this works with %, since / is ignored by Quake.<BR>
<BR>
* Various detail improvements.<BR>
<BR>
+ The lens command is back, and it comes with arguments (Sniper Rifle only):<BR>
  lens		zooms in (with overflow, means 6x will become 1x)<BR>
  lens in	zooms in as well, but without overflow<BR>
  lens out	zooms out, no overflow<BR>
  lens 1	unzooms<BR>
  lens 2	zooms to 2x<BR>
  lens 4	zooms to 4x<BR>
  lens 6	zooms to 6x<BR>
<BR>
+ If you reload while using dual pistols and carrying only one pistol clip,
  you automatically change to single pistol, then reload.<BR>
