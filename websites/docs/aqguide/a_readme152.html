<BR>

become a spectator)<BR>
<BR>

teammates, or when you're an observer, but this can be used to turn it off if

left-handed, 2 = "center"-handed), you can select "classic" style shooting
(where shots end up left/right and below the crosshair), or "classic high"
style shooting (where shots end up left/right of the crosshair).  The
proper commands to select those modes are: hand "0 classic" (right-handed
classic), hand "0 classic high" (right-handed classic high), etc.  Note
that the double-quotes are required.<BR>
<BR>
choose: chooses a particular item or weapon as your item or weapon, without
going through the menus, in teamplay (ie: "choose mp5/10 submachinegun" or
"choose lasersight").<BR>
<BR>
(The remaining commands are all radio/partner-related...)<BR>
<BR>
radio: sends a message on the radio, in whatever your default mode is (set with
the "channel" command, defaults to team).  Useable in teamplay, teams-by-skin
DM, or teams-by-model DM.  Valid messages are: 1 ("one"), 2 ("two"), 3

for the valid messages.<BR>
<BR>
radioteam: sends a radio message to your team, see the "radio" command for the

want to partner with's name displayed on your HUD, then use the "partner"

OTHER CONFIGURATION<BR>
<BR>
IP banning is supported in the standard Q2 3.20 form.  See below for full
details from id's documentation.<BR>
<BR>
Flood protection is supported using the standard Q2 3.20 variables,
"flood_msgs" (default 4), "flood_persecond" (default 4), and "flood_waitdelay"
(default 10).<BR>
<BR>
DM teams-by-model, teams-by-skin, friendly fire, etc are supported using
the standard Q2 "dmflags" values.  A server should use dmflags 256 for
"normal" play (including no friendly fire), 0 for friendly fire.  Some of
the other regular dmflags are also available, such as "spawn farthest"
(512).<BR>
<BR>
action/action.ini is the configuration file for map rotation and teamplay team
name/model/skin setup.  See the example for information on the format.<BR>
<BR>
action/motd.txt, if present, will be appended to the server MOTD.  The
server command "sv reloadmotd" can be used to reload it from disk at any
time, and it is also reloaded at the end of each level automatically.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IP BANNING<BR>
<BR>
Commands: sv addip, sv removeip, sv listip, sv writeip
Server variables: filterban<BR>
<BR>
You can add or remove addresses from the IP filter list with the commands
"sv addip &lt;ip>" and "sv removeip &lt;ip>".  The IP address is specified in
numeric dot format, and any unspecified digits will match any value, so
you can specify an entire class C network with "addip 240.200.100", for
example. "sv removeip" will only remove an address specified in the exact
same way.  The "sv listip" command will print the current list of filters.  
The "sv writeip" command will dump the current filters to a config file,
"listip.cfg" in your Action directory.  You should add a line in your
normal server.cfg that does an "exec listip.cfg" to load this file by
default.  IP addresses in the filter list will only be prohibited from
connecting if the "filterban" variable is set to 1 (this is the default).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
OTHER SERVER COMMANDS<BR>
<BR>
sv reloadmotd: reloads the MOTD file from disk.<BR>
<BR>
sv nextmap: immediately skips to the next map in the rotation.<BR>
