<BR>

<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>

	This command will play an local, public sound hearable to
	anyone who is near. Every person may play only one public sound 
	at the same time. It is played on the channel, where the pain 
	sounds are played too. If someone dont got the sound, it wont 
	be played, so to have fun make sure, that players may download 
	them. The sounds have to be placed in the action directory, 
	"sounds\user". If autodownload is enabled, they may be  downloaded
	within quake. To do this, you have to add your sounds to a file 
	called sndlist.ini which have to be placed in your AQ2 directory.
	See the file sndlist.ini for further details.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

	You currently may ignore up to 10 players.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ignorenum [number]<BR>
------------------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	Same effect as ignore, but by number.
	Some players may try to avoid to be ignored, by giving strange, 
	duplicated or no names. If you aren't able to ignore a player 
	by name, you may do it by number.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ignoreclear<BR>
-----------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	All currently ignored players aren't ignored no more. This will also
	happen when level changes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
maplist<BR>
-------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	This will list all maps for which players may vote. The command name 
	was changed  from "votelist" to "maplist", because there may be more 
	votings instead of just the maps. :)
	Original remark:<BR>
<BR>
	List the percentages of votes to each map, and how many who
	have voted.  Also lists the maps that can be voted on.  (Only
	if "use_mapvote" is enabled.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
votemap [mapname]<BR>
-----------------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	Let a player vote for a map. The command name was changed from "vote"

<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>

	Use this command to vote on to kick a certain player.
	If you allready voted on that player, your vote will be
	removed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
votekicknum [number] [!NEW!]<BR>
--------------------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	Same effect as votekick, but by number.
	Some players may try to avoid to be kicked, by giving strange, 
	duplicated or no names. If you aren't able to vote for a 
	player to be kicked by by name, you may do it by number.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
addpoint [description]<BR>
----------------------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	Now it is possible to set some map points together with a description.
	All added points are saved within a text file found in your map 
	directory and named like the maps with the extension ".pg". This
	points are read in during map initialization and used for new % 
	variables %G and %L. This is only a server side extention what means,
	that clients do not need to have the .pg files and if so, they will
	be ignored. Addpoint will only be enabled, with cheats set on 1 to
	prevent clients to add new points during gameplay. Currently a maximum
	of 60 points are supported.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
NEW % VARIABLES:<BR>
================<BR>
<BR>
%E: Enemies name<BR>
%F: Enemies weapon<BR>
%G: Enemies position<BR>
-----------------------------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	These variables will only show contents, if you directly see an enemy 
	and look at. If not, you get something like "no enemy", "no weapon" 
	and "nowhere". When a .pg file (see above) is present, the enemies
	position (%G) is named to the nearest location point. If not, a relative
	position is given. The enemies relative position is the position as seen 
	from the reporting person, e.g. "in the southwest, up" or "in the north, 
	down". If your teammate is elswhere, it wont help him. But if your 
	teammate is with you or knows where you are, he will get the enemies 
	hideout.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
%K: Last killed player<BR>
----------------------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	This variable stands for the last killed player. It will show contents 
	only once. After usage it contains "No one". <BR>
	Example: If you killed "player" and report it due "say_team I killed %K" 
	to your teammates, you will get "I killed player".<BR>
	If you use it twice without killing someone between, you will get 
	"I killed No one".<BR>
	This is to prevent taunting and message flooding.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
%L: Location<BR>
------------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	This variable gives the players current position. The nearest point taken
	from a .pg file is searched and its description is used. If no .pg file
	for the current map is found, %L will result in "somewhere".<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
%S: Seen location [!NEW!]<BR>
-----------------<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
	This variable is similar to %G, but it will report the seen
	location. If a .pg location file is present, it will show
	the desctiption of the seen place. If not, it will report
	a relative position.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
BUG FIXES<BR>
=========<BR>
	- Fixed the "Out of ammo" bug, which happens due fast reload
	  since AQ2 v1.51. This happened if you had hit the reload
	  button a couple of times and you were killed during
	  reloading.<BR>
	- Fixed infravision on dead bodies. It was annoying that
	  dead corpses were still seen through infravision. Now
	  dead bodies will "cool out" (really fast :).<BR>
	- Fixed "player died" bug...this happened if a player was
	  wounded and did not bandage...after a while, he died
	  from the wound "without cause". Not more!<BR>
