1.  Who we are/Credits

    We are the AQDT, the Action Quake Development Team.  We make mods 
for the mod of Action Quake.  With Espionage's scripting language, you can 
create your own gameplay.  Scenarios, as they're called, can use any map 
you can dream of and make it how you want it to be.  Although the scenario 
language is new, with a little bit of learning and reading, you can make your 
own scenarios for any map made for Quake 2.

2.  What do client operators need to know

  As of v3.3, AQ:E uses a different naming scheme for weapon sounds.
  The sounds map as follows:

  Mk23       sound/weapons/blastf1a.wav 
  Shotgun    No change 
  Handcannon sound/weapons/sshotf1b.wav 
  MP5        sound/weapons/machgf1b.wav 
             sound/weapons/machgf2b.wav 
             sound/weapons/machgf3b.wav 
             sound/weapons/machgf4b.wav 
             sound/weapons/machgf5b.wav 
             (Yes, all of them are the same MP5 sound)  
  SSG-3000   sound/weapons/hyprbf1a.wav 
  M4         sound/weapons/rocklf1a.wav 
  Silencer   sound/weapons/rocklf1b.wav
             (The RL actually plays two sounds, so we have to 
              make this sound quiet) 

  AQ:Espionage introduces some new client commands:

  * "goals" - Redisplays the current objectives for both teams. 
  * "ignore <player name>" - Lets you ignore messages from a particular player
  * "unignore" - Clears your ignore field
  * "volunteer" - Makes you eligible for special duty
  * "scenarios" - Lists the scenarios in rotation on the server

  For scenarios authors, additional commands are available when sv_author
is set to 1 (see below):

  * "moveto <target name>" - moves the player to the location of the
      specified target
  * "movespawn <target name> <away>" - Moves the players to <away>'th
      nearest spawn spot to the specified target

  New radio sounds are included with Espionage.  See aqdt-radio.txt.

  The %L location variable for messages is now supported. AQ:E currently
supports two forms of location specification: 

  1) All TARGET_AREA, TARGET_LOCATION, and TARGET_FLAG#_SPAWN targets in
     an AQ:E script

  2) A map-specific auxiliary file, action/location/<mapname>.loc. This
     file is read for all forms of gameplay, including regular TP and DM.
 
     <mapname>.loc consists of a series of entries of the form

        TARGET_LOCATION "Location Name" ( x y z )

  If the server has it enabled, players may vote on various items. Currently,
AQ:E supports voting to move to the next map/scenario in rotation and voting 
to move to a specific map/scenario in the rotation.

  The gameplay will vary with each scenario. The goals of each scenario
will be displayed on the screen at the beginning of each round. Some players 
may be designated in special roles, in which case it is vital that you read 
the goals specified to determine what needs to be done. Some scenarios are
continuous, which means the players won't "reset" when the goals have been
met.

2a.  Ettiquette for client operators

  Since some Espionage scenarios allow people to respawn, "Enemy Down," 
"Im Hit," "Enemy Spotted" and other related radio/text messages are neither
necessary nor useful.  Please unbind them, or dont use them in respawning
scenarios.  If you do use them during a scenario with respawning, you may 
aggravate the server op and the other players.

3.  What do server ops need to know

  To get imediately started with Espionage out of the box, extract the
server files into your action directory.  Enable the scenario code by either
including the line "set scripts 1" in your server.cfg file or adding 
"+set scripts 1" to you startup command line. The maps and scenarios are
specified in action/action.scp, which includes the scenarios from the
"scenes" subdirectory using a C-like #include statement. After that, 
everything will take care of itself, assuming you extracted the files to the 
proper directories :).  

  Sample command line:

quake2 +set dedicated 1 +set game action +exec server.cfg

  Cvars:

  * scripts <0|1> (default: 0)
    - 0: normal teamplay
    - 1: scripted teamplay

  * escore <0|1> (default: 1)
    - 0: original AQ scoreboard
    - 1: enhanced Espionage scoreboard

  * e_voteWait <secs> (default: 120)
    - Number of seconds between successive vote requests by a player

  * e_mustVolunteer <0|1> (default: 1)
    - 0: anyone can be special player
    - 1: a player must 'volunteer' to be a special player

  * allow_vote <0|1> (default: 1)
    - 0: voting is disabled
    - 1: voting is enabled

  * sv_author <0|1> (default: 0)
    - 0: normal mode
    - 1: author mode - player spawn locations are visible, 'moveto' and 
          'movespawn' commands are enabled

4.  What's Different

  There are many new and exciting features in AQ: Espionage:

  New radio sounds for both female and male are implemented
  Automatic sounds for when you capture/return/assassinate
  Bonus points for capturing, assassinating, defending, harrasing 
    bodyguards, or invading
  Teammates get small bonuses if someone on their team captures
  HUD indicator for 'special' players (ie: leader, package carrier)
  Door kicking enabled, if some chump is blocking a door with their 
    body, just jump kick the door!
  You can ignore and unignore players (look in Total Commands list for 
    more info) 
  HUD display to tell you when you might respawn. This display is located 
    under frag count 
  There are several respawn options that can be set up differently per team:
    - instant respawn (normal DM click-to-spawn)
    - timed respawn (the HUD indicator shows how many seconds left till 
        respawn)
    - periodic respawn (the HUD indicator shows how many seconds left till 
        respawn)
    - percentage respawn (the HUD indicator shows the percentage of your 
        team in DEAD mode)
  Dead people can talk to the living if respawning is enabled, but dead 
    people can only chasecam their teammates (no free flight)
  Stealth Slippers are beefed up.  User doesn't receive the 'limp mode' 
    walk when they get shot in leg.  User also gets less falling damage and 
    can fall down farther.  
  
  Other features have been added to fix standing AQ bugs, accomodate 
limited network bandwidth and help prevent client overflows:

  Weapons and item entities that are dropped have a 10 or 30 second 
    life-span
  Out of ammo scroll bug fixed (Thanks goes to Mike from AQ:G)
  Long bleeder died bug fixed
  Opening the menu cuts off the MOTD refreshes 
  Optimized network traffic for weapon sounds
        
5. Rules

  The rules of the game are defined by the scenario made for that map.  
Generally, most scenarios fall under these categories: 

  CTB - [Capture The Briefcase] two briefcases and two bases. One BC spawns 
        at one base, and the other spawns at the other.
    
  ATL - [Assassinate The Leader] two randomly selected players become the 
        leader of each team.  The first team to assassinate the enemy
        leader wins.
    
  FRD - [Find, Retrieve/Defend] a randomly selected player on one team is 
        chosen to pickup a package from a fixed location, and deposit it at 
        another fixed location.  The enemy team's objective is to 
        assassinate the randomly selected player.

  ETV - [Escort the VIP] a randomly selected player on one team is chosen 
        to be escorted to a fixed location to win. The enemy team must 
        assassinate that randomly selected player.
    
  OFC - [One Flag Capture] two teams battle it out for a single package to 
        bring to their base.  The package is spawned in a neutral location.

  CNH - [Capture and Hold] teams vie for control of territories; holding
        a territory for a certain period of time scores points
    
  Rules that exist in all variants of Espionage scenarios:
    1) Anyone who is picking up the package needs to hold the handgun or knife
    2) A CNH target must be occupied for two seconds in order to take control


6.  Scenarios

  Scenarios are the heart of AQ: Espionage. Scenarios are activated by
setting the 'scripts' variable to 1, as described in section 3 above.
If scripts is set to 0, gameplay will be regular teamplay (or deathmatch if 
teamplay is set to 0).  

  The AQ: Espionage release includes several sample scenarios that operate
on a range of maps. Some scenarios (in particular those that don't require
map coordinates) may be used with any map. Espionage will try to follow
the map rotation specified in action.scp as best it can. If a map is
manually loaded (e.g., via the 'map' command) that is not in the rotation, 
gameplay reverts to regular teamplay for the duration of that map. If map
is manually loaded that IS in the rotation, then the first scenario in
the rotation associated with that map is loaded.

  You are encouraged to make your own scenarios; however, the AQDT strongly 
urges you not to make scenarios that have poor playability.  Also, it is not 
recommended that you drastically modify the scenarios that we provide.  When 
we say 'drastically' we mean that it's ok to change the team names, and 
skins; but take care in modifying the goal spots and other 'drastic' things.
If you do make such drastic changes, please change the name of the scenario 
to minimize confusion.

 If you do not wish to create your own scenarios, just make sure you have 
action.scp in /quake2/action, and all the *.scn's in /quake2/action/scenes 
directory and you're set. (Dont forget to have scripts 1 in your startup 
file!).  If you DO wish to make your own scenarios, there is a 
/quake2/action/devel directory which has a devel.txt document on how to 
create scenarios, debug them, example files, and other server side options.
