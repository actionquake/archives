<B>Introduction</B><BR>
<BR>
Action Quake2 is a Quake 2 modification where stealth, strategy, ammo conservation, 
and accuracy are what matter.  Rather than who can get to the BFG fastest.  Try it out, see 
how you like it, we think it's probably the most fun we've ever had playing Quake, but we're
biased.<BR>
<BR>
Below you will find all the information you need to get fragging.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Getting Started</B><BR>
<BR>
After installation you should load up a game and get tour configuration set up.   
There are a few commands you need to know and bind, I will go into details about each one a 
bit later:<BR>
<BR>

Be sure to read <A HREF="a_radio.html"><I><B>radio.txt</B></I></A> to use the radio commands.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Action Quake2 may differ from what you are used to; this is how we planned it.<BR>
<BR>
opendoor * Doors, for one, do not open automatically, like in Quake 2.  Instead you will 
have to actually open the door with the 'opendoor' command that I told you to bind.  This 
is to encourage thoughtful, strategic play, rather than the 'run, shoot' matches Quake 
games often turn into.<BR>
<BR>
bandage * Another thing that might take some getting used to is our unique damage code.  
Instead of taking a set amount of damage, wounds are actually inflicted on regions of your 
body.  While head wounds are almost always fatal, some wounds will continue to bleed and 
create other adverse effects.  To stop the bleeding and any other effects of the wound 
simply hit your 'bandage' key, but beware; bandaging takes six seconds, during which time 
you cannot fire.  There is no way to regain lost hit points, so try not to get shot.<BR>
<BR>
reload * This empties your gun of all rounds currently in it and loads a new clip.  Ammo is 
scarce so be careful with this one. <BR>
<BR>
drop item * This is simple, it drops whatever special item you currently have.<BR>
<BR>
drop weapon * Also simple, drops your unique weapon.<BR>
<BR>
weapon * The sniper rifle comes equipped with a high powered visible light scope.  It has 
three lenses to accommodate your sniping needs.  1x, 2x, 4x, and 6x, the 'lens' command 
cycles through them.  Also changes the pistol between fully and semi-auto modes. For the knife,
this switches between slice and throw modes. For the Mp5 and M4, this changes between 3 round
burst mode and full automatic mode...<BR>
<BR>
One other quick reminder, fall damage has been greatly increased in this mod, so 
don't go jumping out of any 3rd story windows.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Weapons</B><BR>
<BR>
The heart of any mod, the big guns. <BR>
<BR>
The Knife<BR>
The SOG-37 is the knife of choice for the Navy SEALs, and it is for you as well.  
Killing swiftly and silently this is good is good in close quarters combat as well as when 
you run out of ammo. You can also throw them, increasing damage!<BR>
<BR>
The Pistol<BR>
The H&K Mk23 pistol is the standard side-arm used by SpecOps units world-wide, and 
with good reason.   A single shot to the head is enough to take down anyone, and unless 
your opponent is wearing a vest a few shots to the chest area are also quite fatal.<BR>
<BR>
Many people prefer this weapon above all others simply because it is reliable, 
accurate and deadly.  One thing to be aware of when using this gun is its range, while it 
retains much of its power at close range it lacks punch at very long ranges.  Ammo comes in 
clips of 12 rounds, but you can only carry two extra clips at a time.<BR>
<BR>
Use 'weapon' to switch it to semiautomatic. This increases accuracy at the cost of
fire rate.<BR>
<BR>
Akimbo Pistols<BR>
Kill somebody, get another Mk23.  'Nuff said.<BR>
<BR>
The Shotgun<BR>
The old standby, the M3 Assault Shotgun is perfect in that medium range fighting.  
It carries 7 rounds that must be reloaded one at a time.  This one functions much the same 
as the Quake 2 shotgun, with one obvious difference, power.  One good, clean shot can take 
anyone down, and even grazing hits will hurt them.  The knock-back from this baby is 
impressive to say the least, makes it perfect for blasting people off a roof or out a 
window.  You can carry 14 shells at a time, plus whatever is in the gun itself.  This 
weapon is unique and there is only one on the level.  You can only carry one unique weapon 
at a time.<BR>
<BR>
The Sub-Machine Gun<BR>
Although wildly inaccurate the MP5/10 more than makes up for it by shooting very 
fast.  Less powerful than the pistol it's quite useful when clearing a room.  It holds 30 
rounds per clip and you can carry two extra clips at a time.  Reload time is the same as the 
pistol. This weapon is unique. Use 'weapon' to switch to 3 round burst mode and increase accuracy.<BR>
<BR>
The Sniper Rifle<BR>
A Sig Sauer SSG 3000 fitted with a powerful scope, this gun is not to be trifled 
with.  Although terribly inaccurate if shot from the hip, it is deadly when sighted and 
aimed properly.  The scope can be switched from 2x, to 4x, all the way down to 6x.  The 
rifle has a 6-round box attached that must be reloaded one round at a time.  Bullets come 
in containers of 10, and you can carry up to 20 extra rounds. This weapon is unique.<BR>
<BR>
Try hitting reload repeatedley while reloading. It will put more than one in at a time.<BR>
<BR>
The Assault Rifle<BR>
This is a special issue M4, basically a scaled down version of the M16.  As you 
would expect it is accurate and deadly.  The rounds are also penetrating so they actually 
pass through the victim and can hit people behind him.  It carries 24 rounds per clip but 
only one extra clip may be carried at a time. Use 'weapon' to switch to 3 round burst mode
and increase accuracy.<BR>
<BR>
The Hand Cannon<BR>
Word to the wise; don't get in front of this thing.  Basically a sawed off 
double-barrel shotgun it's spread is wide enough to kill just about anyone getting too 
close.  However, this benefit causes the gun to become nearly useless at long and medium 
range.  It uses the same ammo as the shotgun but only holds two shells at a time. This 
weapon is unique.<BR>
<BR>
The Grenades<BR>
If you see an M26 Frag Grenade thrown you had better take cover fast. Even if it 
doesn't kill you it is liable to blow you out a window or break your legs.  Of course the 
one who threw it is just as susceptible to it's effects, and impatient handling of these 
has led to more than one player blasting himself.  You can only carry 2 at a time, so use 
them wisely.<BR>
<BR>
Duck to reduce damage by this sucker by half. Use 'weapon' to increase your throwing
range...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Items</B><BR>
<BR>
Akin to the runes from CTF these items can be held in addition to your unique 
weapon, making for some very interesting combinations.  You can only carry one item at a 
time, but can drop your current item by using the 'dropitem' command.<BR>
<BR>
The Kevlar Vest<BR>
All shots to your chest do no damage, however, you are still knocked back and can 
be shot out a window.  The grenades, shotgun, knife, and hand cannon can still penetrate 
the vest however, and a well placed shot from any other weapon will do damage as normal.<BR>
<BR>
The Silencer<BR>
The Pistol, MP5, and Rifle all become 'silenced'.  They give no muzzle flash and 
make only the tiniest noise.  This and the sniper rifle makes for a very dangerous foe.  
Takes a few moments to put on a weapon.<BR>
<BR>
The Laser Sight<BR>
Projects a beam of light from the tip of your gun.  This not only increases you 
ability to aim the weapon; it also increases the accuracy o the weapon.  Don't let the guy 
with the MP5 get this item.  This also takes a few moments to install.<BR>
<BR>
The Stealth Slippers<BR>
These finely crafted silken slippers will muffle your footsteps, making you silent 
as a cat. Long falls and other activities still make noise.<BR>
<BR>
The Bandolier <BR>
This item allows you to increase your max clips per weapon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Semi-FAQ</B><BR>
<BR>
Q:  When I jump off the building I keep dying, what gives?<BR>
A:  Fall damage has been increased greatly in Action Quake2.  Really, how impressed would
    you be if you shot that guy out the window, only to watch him scamper off?<BR>
<BR>
Q:  I'm losing life and it won't stop!  What gives?<BR>
A:  You are bleeding, bandage up by typing 'bandage' at the console.  I suggest binding a 
    key to do this for you.<BR>
<BR>
Q: I died in one hit from that guy!  What gives?<BR>
A: He's not cheating, he probably shot you in the head.  Try and do it back to him.  There, 
   feel better?<BR>
<BR>
Q: I'm having trouble moving!  What gives?<BR>
A: You are limping, bandage up.<BR>
<BR>
Q: Where do I get more health?  I'm at 3 life!<BR>
A: You don't.  Don't worry about it though, you are still as lethal at 3 life as you are at 
   a 100.<BR>
<BR>
Q:  Why does this game cater to campers?<BR>
A:  We don't think it does, but it certainly isn't a normal game of Quake.  If there is a 
    camper that is bugging you, toss a grenade at him.<BR>
<BR>
Q:  Any more questions I should ask?<BR>
A:  Not any I can think of, but if anyone does have any questions, game play related or 
    otherwise, don't hesitate to write us at ateam@telefragged.com<BR>
