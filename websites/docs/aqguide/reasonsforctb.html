                  REASONS CTB ROCKS
                     BY pot-shot


1. Every weapon has an effective place in CTB


MP5/10:

  Long range group spray, great rushing weapon, just take 
out someone's head and move on.  You just spawned in too 
far away to catch that group escorting the opposing team's 
package?  Welp, nothing better for long range spray then 
the mp5...  take out 4-5 heads, hell maybe even the carrier 
in the process...  give your boys time to return that package.

M3:

  Ok, nothing in CTB is a more versatile weapon--it's what you 
would call the weapon for the indecisive.  It makes for an 
amazing rushing weapon; take out the defensive in 5-6 well 
placed shots. It's also good for scaring back idiots who try 
to kill you in the routes between bases.  However, Where 
this gun really shines is in defense--it's got quite a range 
and allows you to disrupt the strafing of their carrier.  
Also, near the package its 1 shot 1 kill which is always handy.

HC:

  Now, CTB is cool because finally, since deathmatch, alot of 
weapons play an effective role--the Handcannon being 
one of the best.  It's the best "close to case spawn" defensive 
weapon in the game.  I also believe it's up there with MP5/10, 
M4, and M3 in rushing weapons.  You're already going Mach 5 across 
the map--what better than a weapon you really don't have to aim 
with at that speed?

SSG:

  Oh jeez, do I even have to bring this up?  This is without 
a doubt the BEST defensive weapon in CTB.  You have layers 
of protection:  You can try to stop them from penetrating 
at 6x distance, then 4x distance, then 2x, hell, then 1x--take 
out the pistol.  You have so many chances at the enemy!  It 
also helps to have a sniper around for a rush of the opposing 
team's base.  Your sniper can peg off their HC's and their snipers 
from the background while you rush the package.  

M4:

  Ok, IMO this is the best escorting weapon in the world.  Quick, 
fast frags so they can't get enough time to peg your carrier.  
Many times you can also take out 3-4 people from their defense 
in one clip and pretty much overrun their base alone if necessary. 
Defensively, the weapon is damn good but you tend to run out of 
ammo too soon.  

Knives:

  Wow, what can I say?  If you have a designated runner who can 
really really strafe and knows how to knife, then he can be 
the most dangerous player out on the field.  Mostly because the 
fucker gets the package and then still has a plethora of ammo 
left to take on would-be carrier fraggers.  Also, many times you 
can pull off a one-man infiltration of a base and get out with 
the package in no time because of how quiet the attack is with 
knives.  Defensively...  ahh forget about it.  You can get lucky, 
but too many times you gotta take 5 guys on at once and it's nearly 
impossible and just get fucked over.  I could see some effective 
lame camping with them, though.

Akimbos:

  It's amazing how effective these really are.  A great 
carrier gimper, not to mention defensively you got enough 
ammo to take out guys for a long while.  Offensively, you 
can be extremely effective because akimbos have damn good 
range for sniping and then you just stand up and take out 
the heads of those auto users, handcannoners, and M3 users 
many times.  Like the knives, though, an akimbo is a great 
lone case runner weapon because after he gets the flag, he 
has like another 24 rounds to fool with to gimp and/or kill 
would-be carrier fraggers.  
	


2. Every Item has an effective place in CTB


Kevlar Vest:

  One of the main things about CTB is staying alive while 
still being effective--that is what kevlar does for you.  
You can live through heated battle, get the case, and still 
have enough life left to make a succesful run at the flag.  
You can also play a defensive role for an entire map without 
getting killed if you do it right, hehe.

Laser Sight:

  Much of this game is based upon who gets killed fastest, 
sort of like teamplay.  Here, if you can kill 3 people 
before they injure you and overrun the your base, you 
may have sealed the victory for your team.  A laser sight 
is always a great item.  It allows you to keep moving and 
not get hit and still be extremely effective in slaughtering 
multiple opponents.  This is why it's one of the most 
widely-used items in the game.  

Slippers:

  The cool thing about CTB is that stealth slippers provide 
you with a lot less fall damage and let you drop with no damage 
from many high heights.  Also, leg damage only stops you from 
jumping--not running.  This is a great rushing utility as it 
allows for a great flag runner to keep moving fast even after 
the dreaded and usually fatal leg damage.  It also allows for 
a much speedier getaway since you will not have to worry about 
leg damage as much.  Then there's the fact that you walk silently.  
If you can approach the flag unexpectedly or from an expected 
direction, many times the opponent doesn't notice you until you 
pick up the package and they hear the agonizing thud that is 
associated with it. 

Silencer:

  On offense it's not so effective, but defensively it 
can be one of the most effective items in the game.  The 
rushers can't dispose of you if they can't figure out 
where the hell you are.  The silencer does just that--provides 
cover for you.   It also initially disguises what weapons the 
rushers are dealing with--giving you an early advantage.  

Bandolier:

  This can be a great item especially on big maps.  It gives 
you more ammo to live longer and not have to go on big 
one-knife/one-pistol runs.  Also, it comes with a hand grenade; 
it is very handy for clearing out an area or disposing of a 
camped out flag carrier waiting for the case to return.  
On defense this is great for the awesome sniper/shotgun or any 
weapon that knows how to stay alive but just runs out of ammo 
eventually and becomes useless with the weapons he picks up 
off the ground.  



3. The LPB/HPB issue is softened quite a bit


  CTB's playing field allows for the merging and co-existance 
of many styles of players, from the stealthy and sneaky to the 
strafey and crazy.  However, among this co-existance comes 
the LPB and the HPB.  Though the HPB's role is decidedly 
defensive many times in CTB, in no other game, teamplay nor 
deathmatch, can a HPB compete like they can in CTB.  CTB allows 
you to play the style of game YOU want to play.  A HPB can be 
very very effective in their style of play, playing the corners, 
avoiding the melees, etc.  



4. Much more tension


  Just like when it's down to the last two guys in TP and both 
are at 1 health, the tension in CTB is immense when you are 
chasing after a carrier and you know your case has just been 
returned... or both carriers are dead and it's a race to see 
who can return and capture the case... in any event it's awesome!



Conclusion:

  CTB is a whole fucking lot of fun that solves some of the 
bitching issues that are in teamplay and deathmatch about 
weapon overuse and the LBP/HBP issue...  

  I hope this was insightful!
