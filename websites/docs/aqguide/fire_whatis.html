<p><em>What is AQ2 : FireTeams?</em></p>
<p>FireTeams is a modification of the original AQ2 code (currently 
at V1.52). It allows players to create and join teams at will, similar
to the team system in Rocket Arena 2. Players may choose to create
a team of their own, or join an existing team. The intention of this
is to create more intensive team games, whether they be of large numbers
(e.g. 4 teams of 4 players) or of small closely nit teams.</p>
<p>Originally this idea came from Gandalf in the uk.games.computer.quake2
newsgroup, I took the idea on and have coded this mod. Gandalfs original
idea was for teams of 2 players to go round together, hunting each
other down. To allow for this I have set the current maximum players on
each team to default at 2, this can be altered by server admins though.</p>
<p>FireTeams is a server side only mod, so you need only download the files
if you intend to run a server yourself (possibly on a Lan even). However
if you do wish to test the mod out, then by all means download the server
files yourself. However I must remind you to backup the current gamex86.dll
file in your action directory before installing this mod.</p>
<p>Anyway I hope you enjoy using this mod, if you have any suggestions for
alterations, additions and improvements (or even new mods) then
please make use of the form on the suggestions page.</p>
