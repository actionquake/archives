                  is a small level, resembling a monastery or burial ground of 
                  sorts. It is very enclosed, but the many hallways and elaborate 
                  sewer systems provide fluid movement throughout the map. Several 
                  tunnels and hallways connect the rooms, ranging from a burial 
                  tomb, an M4 wielding altar, a sewer, and an outdoor alcove overlooked 
                  by two small sniper towers.</FONT></P>

                    First, let's cover the sniping. While there are not many sniping 
                    opprotunities on this map, there are some. The sniper rifle 
                    is located in the tower in the upper-left of figure K-1. There 
                    is also a sniper rifle behind this point of view. If you're 
                    going to be sniping, I suggest the fortified tower, shown 
                    in figure K-2. A good strategy is to wait for a player to 
                    move towards the darkened arch. If you see an enemy head toward 
                    the doorway, put your crosshair where they will eventually 
                    be, and let them do the work for you. If they walk into your 
                    crosshair (which is almost a guarantee), squeeze a shot off. 
                    </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Also, dont forget 
                    about those dirty spawn kills. There is a player-spawn point 
                    in the lower left of figure K-1. But be careful -- you tick 
                    enough people off, they'll hunt for you.</FONT></P>

                  Here's the sniper tower, looking into the bell room. Those slabs 
                  swing back and forth -- which should prove to be your primary 
                  defense. Wait until an adversary attempts to walk across the 
                  ledge, and pick him off with your sniper rifle. Also, there 
                  is a ladder on the far left ladge. Ladders provide an easy shot 
                  on an unexpecting fool. Just plant your crosshair att he top 
                  of the ladder, and calmy remove the better half of his head 
                  when it floats into your crosshair.</FONT></P>
                <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">This is a very 
                  critical room in the flow of the map. Under your perch gives 
                  players access to the outdoor area in Figure K-1, and the ladder 
                  leads you to a clip bearing room, with an elevator. Also, to 
                  the left of K-3, is a small ramp leading up from the altar room, 
                  shown in figure K-4. Watch the ramp -- it isn't traveled quite 
                  as often as the ladder, but this tends to be one of the favored 
                  grenade chucking locations. A player, grabbing the grenade from 
                  the altar room, will rush into the bell tower and drop his explosive 
                  friend, usually pulling off a kill or three.</FONT></P>
                <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Another warning: 
                  This tower has a back-entrance. Right outside the door under 
                  your sniper cove is a series of dirt steps and a grenade. They 
                  are quite high, and difficult to make while supressing fire, 
                  but if an enemy manages to get to the top, you'd better run 
                  -- fast. The grenadier tends to stand on the top ledge and casually 
                  toss a grenade in. This usually gets them a kill. Keep that 
                  in mind.</FONT></P>

                  This is another big-action room. Keep your eyes peeled in this 
                  room. It's not as crowded as some of the others, but the M4 
                  holder tends to hang around here. Nearby are a grenade and several 
                  pistol clips, along with a few suprises: There is a ladder in 
                  this room that brings you up to the sniper cove on the far left 
                  corner of Figure K-1, and a &quot;secret&quot; hatch that reveals 
                  the hand-cannon and sewer access. It is slighty shaded differently 
                  then the other walls, so you'll see it. The altar room has a 
                  hole that you can dive down in an emergency, as well, planting 
                  you safely in the sewer water below.</FONT></P>
                <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">A good strategy 
                  for this map, is to grab the handcannon from the secret room, 
                  snag the shells, and retreat back to this room. Slowly sneak 
                  around the room, sneaking up on fools looking for the M4. Weave 
                  in and out of the pillars, looking for victims. You can usually 
                  get a frag or two just standing in the secret room, waiting 
                  for an unsuspecting sap to saunter in, and fill his upper body 
                  with buckshot.</FONT></P>
                <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">I don't recommend 
                  trying to snipe from the tower mentioned earlier. The ladder 
                  in this room gives easy access, and there is little cover. A 
                  pistol user could easily duck and be doen with you from the 
                  ground, or he could simply go around without much trouble.</FONT></P>

                  The eerily tinted sewer system... shown in figure K-5. This 
                  location is campers top choice. One of the top reasons for this 
                  is the multitude of spawn points down here. A favorite sniper/camper 
                  location is the water in the foreground of the K-5 screenshot. 
                  Usually waiting for a melee fighter to dive into the water for 
                  cover, they sit, waiting with their SSG 3000, waiting for the 
                  victim to swim into the small water straight-away. Underwater 
                  makes you very immobile while trying to duck and maneuver, and 
                  the sniper relies on this. Your best defense is simple: stay 
                  out of the water.</FONT></P>
                <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">That may seem a 
                  little too cautious. It is. Just remember not to dive headfirst 
                  into water without checking your six.</FONT></P>
                <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Also, beware. The 
                  sewer access mentioned in figure the K-4 description plants 
                  you right in front of the sniper location. Snipers love this... 
                  you'll hate it. Think twice before jumping down that hole. It's 
                  a risk.</FONT></P>
